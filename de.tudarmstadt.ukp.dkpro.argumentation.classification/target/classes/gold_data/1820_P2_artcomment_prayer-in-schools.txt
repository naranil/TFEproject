At this point in our history with government run schools that are failing by almost every standard, it may be the time to shut them down. Open private schools that are free to teach religion, have prayer Bible reading, and let each parent decide where they want to send their child. This would be the American Freedom of choice and Free Market Place that gives you the best product at the best price. The government once it ruled on religious practice in the schools, crossed that high wall which was to separate church and state. It did not rule impartially, but rather it ruled against God. Parents would become more involved in their child's education once they were forced to make a decision on education.
