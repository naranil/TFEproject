My kiddos go to public school, we can't afford private. I HATE the local elementary and I have tried my darndest to be my child's advocate, taking control of teaching, studying, and overseeing issues that arise amongst peers. I am far form the only parent to feel that our school in particular has gone downhill for years. Schools feel like their hands are tied with difficult children (I am more so focusing on the behavior challenged kids) and therefore they run amuck causing chaos: cursing at teachers, starting physical fights, disrupting learning, etc. Those parents defend and point fingers and the teachers are EXHAUSTED and just don't try anymore. So they give up on my kid, who DESERVES so much better!
