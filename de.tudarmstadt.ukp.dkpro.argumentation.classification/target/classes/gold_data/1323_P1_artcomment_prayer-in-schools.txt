Right on Santron and Aaronbz. I was beginning to think that there were no clear heads (other than mine, of course) posting here. And Hannibal, you're half right and thank you for a little humour! 
To repeat a fact that everyone seems to be missing: the Musilm prayers are NOT A SCHOOL-WIDE ACTIVITY THAT OTHERS ARE FORCED TO JOIN. It is not costing the public any $$. It's no different than the chess club. 
I am aware of church congregations who use public schools on Sundays. Is that unacceptable also? Who knows, maybe some atheists or Jewish students may be in the school at the same time for a drama or music rehearsal. What if they happen to catch a glimpse of the church service? Will their lives be ruined? 
Why don't we debate how to help the poor and hungry - a cause that really matters. Or about political parties - an issue that will never be resolved.
