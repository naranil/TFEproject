In the age of technology, school can be anywhere and everywhere people choose. The quality of private or public education both depend on the assets, knowledge resources, ambition and the persistence that a student can have access to. The sky has no limits. In the digital divide over whether or not computers should be used for teaching and learning, parents can provide a classroom that is free of distractions. Children can learn with or without technology. It is a choice. Independent choice is what makes American values so precious.
