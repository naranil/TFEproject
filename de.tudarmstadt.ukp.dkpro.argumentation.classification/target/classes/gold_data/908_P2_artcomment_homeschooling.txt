This is the only really objectionable part (if reported accurately) - providing a power to investigate purely on the basis of home schooling without any other evidence. 
Otherwise, I can't really see a problem about making sure that a homeschooling parent has sufficient ability to deliver adequate education to their child. Doing so on an annual basis is perfectly fair as for most parents there will come a point at which their own knowledge of a subject will be too low to enable them to do so adequately. General education and being a couple of chapters ahead might be OK for younger children, but is probably not going to be enough for those in their mid-teens. 
If homeschoolers often join together with other homeschoolers, the checks provide a benefit to them in giving some assurance about the suitability of other parents to supervise and teach your children.
