My daughter was in the public school system from 1st to 9th grade. I put her in the Cyber Academy in the 10th grade. It doesn't take as long to take the classes and do the course work. Most parents could do this with their kids after work if need be and I know plenty who do. In GA you have to take the GA standardized tests and prove your child is getting an education. You must also register your child's curriculum with the state so they know what you are using. Most state's homeschooling isn't as wide open at VA's program. Our homeschooling association has lots of outings and opportunities for kids to socialize. We have a homeschool band, a choir, an orchestra, opportunites our our local state park in the junior ranger program. The idea being perpetrated by most media is that all homeschool kids are kids who never leave the house and are indoctrinated every day. Not true. Since school doesn't take as long, kids have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of options that would not be available to them in an ordinary school setting. With the Cyber School - they are getting the state education - it's considered just another public school - but some kids do better with that environment that in the public school setting with all the bullying and general meaness that goes on there. Plus the teachers have too many students to care about them individually. My daughter has received more individuallized attention with the cyberschool than the phyiscal brick and mortar school.
