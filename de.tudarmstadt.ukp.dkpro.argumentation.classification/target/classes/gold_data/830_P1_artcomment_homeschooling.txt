You are absolutely right. Particularly about the appalling socialisation of schools. Which are usually the only excuse parents use to force their children to a bad education in a school. 
Absolutely inevitable. It does not even have to be 'by' parents, but controlled by them. Tutors selected and controls by parents individually to fit their child, be it brilliant or thick. But educated to the best for that individual. Schools are the problem of education. They are out of date and time. 
Given the revolution we have now in educational means, and transmission, it is just a matter of how long people will con themselves schools have any place in education any more than steam power has in space rockets.
