I didn’t have the opportunity many have of going to a private school but I have to say that my life isn’t less good than any one who has had that opportunity.   I worked 10 yrs for a company where most of the employee under my wing went to some of the most prestige private schools and collages in my area.  I don’t agree that sending your children to a private school makes you a bad person but I do have to disagree with those who criticize public schools. The values that you teach you children at home along with extra encouragement and attention is all a child needs to succeed in any school whether it’s a private or public.
