Doesn't this particular accommodation stomp on a couple of human rights? In this PUBLIC institution (and I believe some others, too) during class time, only one religious group is allowed to use part of the school--it's closed to all others. Discrimination based on religion, no? The girls are consigned to the "back of the bus" (and others to farther "back of the bus"). Discrimination based on gender, no? Again, in a PUBLIC institution. 
My understanding is that most public schools do accommodate the same religious group, but in acceptable ways. To my mind, what's happening at Valley Park Middle School is profoundly and distressingly unacceptable in a pluralistic, secular society.
