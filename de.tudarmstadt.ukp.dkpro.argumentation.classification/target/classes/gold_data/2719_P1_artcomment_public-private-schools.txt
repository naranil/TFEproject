How is it that sending a child to a private school for religious reasons makes a parent, "bad people"? Our liberal, anti-Christian government and the small minority of whining atheists have cleansed our public schools of any positive values and moral teaching. Revisionist historians have changed the textbooks to honor the immoral and eliminate reference to godly individuals and the good contributions that religion and churches have made to our society. They, instead, use our public schools to promote a liberal agenda and brainwash our children to follow those principles. And this author thinks we are "bad people" for shielding our children from this garbage and creating well-balanced, healthy minded adults who contribute greatly to help our communities? Give me a break!
