In a rough analogy to monocultural farming, I think than any highly homogeneous group of people, while it offers certain efficiencies, is inherently pathology prone. Diversity damps extremes of outlook, need and behavior. Ideally, I donâ€™t think school children should spend as much time as they usually do isolated by age, let alone sex. The unhealthiest social situations I was ever in were an all-boys school and military training.
