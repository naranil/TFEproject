The premise of her argument is valid; however, I don't agree entirely. She also takes it to a level that it need not be, insulting and disrespectful to those that choose to do otherwise. I too went to private (Catholic) school as do my daughters, it is our choice. Our public school district is an award winning one with many distinctions, but I wanted my daughters to as I did be enveloped not only with a good academic environment but live the faith and that ultimately they as adults would make their personal choices how they wanted to carry out their lives, that is the least I can do as their mom. To the point about not contributing to the public schools is a farce, if you are a home owner you pay taxes, property/school/etc etc right, so actually those that choose to send their children to private schools are pay twice or three times over than the average school age family.
