If you can I would suggest Private schooling. Worked for us. I guess it depends on your child as well and the dynamics of your family (boys/girls/both/number of kids). We have 2 boys and they are going to a boys only private school and we're thinking of sending them to a boys only High school as well. It is very costly, but I believe that the two things you can give your children are a good education and lots of love.
