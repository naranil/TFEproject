I taught in public schools for 14 years but when we moved to another state and our church had a school we chose to send her there (and I also teach there) so she would better fit in socially at the church AND Jesus is the cornerstone of our school instead of being banned.  It's also great that we are not ruled by NCLB.  And our school calendar is not determined by tourist season at the beach as are the school calendars of both the states I have taught in.
