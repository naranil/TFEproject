Alas, I am too old to have children in school, but my daughter is a school teacher.  I think it is alright to send your children to a private school, but it is not the solution to the education problem we face.  The deterioration of the home is the root of the problem.  Good parents, rich or poor, are the North Star for the child and his education.  By good parents I mean those who have a strong moral code,  read good books themselves and leave them out so that their children see what they read.  A discussion of the day at the dinner table after grace has been said and affection shown between mom and dad and parent to child. Love requires rules.  Love your children and require obedience.  Does wonders.
