I agree - Kids can do great in the public school system and parents DO need to be involved. The more people leave, the worse its going to become. The public school system lets them deal with real life too, unfortunate that it may be but that is what's out there in college and the work force too. There are still great teachers in the public schools - lets stand behind them.
