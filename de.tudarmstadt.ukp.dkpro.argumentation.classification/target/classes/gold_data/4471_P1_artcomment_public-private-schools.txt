You have to be very careful comparing Australia to the UK and USA. Here we have a parallel public system called systemic Catholic schools - they are low fee charging and widespread across the suburbs - they are not really elitist private schools and when you factor in them to the mix, the figures in private are not that different. 
The best schools for academic achievement are selective state schools - they don't get the unruly kids and they don't get the thick kids whose parents have to pay a lot of money for them to be coached through private school and then use their connections to get a job when they can't do it from their own abilities.
