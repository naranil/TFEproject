what a bunch of hogwash...dekalb county schoold district in jacked up georgia is not worth pigs poop...as a matter of fact, almost all public schools in dekalb county is lower than whale dung.... teachers dont care....  I am all for Private Schools.  I will never let my kids go to public school unless the teachers can prove they can teach.   Teachers pay should be based on performance.  PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SUCKS......  BUNCH OF INEPT SCHOOL TEACHERS.....   Georgia school system really sucks poop....
