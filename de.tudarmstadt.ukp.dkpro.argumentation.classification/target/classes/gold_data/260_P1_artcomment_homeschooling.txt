I am perturbed that Mr. Powell's sister claims that many of her younger siblings spend "most of the day" playing video games - is that educational? I strongly doubt it. Sounds to me as though Mrs. Powell is overwhelmed by having to tend to the education of at least 8 children at home, and lets them do as they will. 
A sibling who can't read by middle school? If the kid is dyslexic, is he doomed because his parents won't/ don't/ can't get assistance for how to handle such a learning challenge? There needs to be some checking in on the homeschooled students' progress. 
Again, Mr. Powell succeeds because he is motivated and very smart; his siblings may not be so motivated, but they deserve to at least learn to read by age 12. Especially if they go into construction or farming - there are many permits/forms to fill out, and people who cannot keep up will end up itinerant laborers - hardly what their parents intended.
