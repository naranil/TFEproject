I've seen wrong and the writer takes it to the extreme. Whatever she's saying about getting involved in public schools proves she has no practical experience with the educational system.   First of all, public schools DO NOT allow any outside influence or criticism of its curriculum. The unions protect the bad and inept teachers and administrators. Students are not taught discipline nor inspired to learn. When I see the stories of personal achievement is not to be recognized, in fact, it's to be discouraged due to other students self esteem, I wonder why bother with an education. Competition is not condoned, again self esteem issues with students and teachers. Tests are no longer pass or fail but how the teacher thinks a student should feel about the test. The idea that a student should graduate with the ability to be an independent thinker is repulsive to the school system.  Self initiative is not tolerated and all students will graduate with identical honors. Plus, social activities tempered with diversity and tolerance are more important than basic math and English skills.   A private school has academic and social requirements that will be met by the student or they will not be allowed to return. Achievement and initiative are REWARDED at private schools. The teachers have a higher degree of success with smaller classrooms. Unacceptable behavior nor bullying is not tolerated and is the grounds for permanent expulsion. Is it any wonder which system turns out the better student and why higher institutions want the private school students?
