I went to an all boys school â€“ Can't say I particularly liked it, I would of much preferred gone to a co-ed. It is closer to the 'real world' that way. Kids should grow up in the company of both sexes... They will be more at ease around the opposite sex when they are older and it just makes sense. 
If it is purely education you are concerned about (and not so much behaviour), our year (at a private school) went shockingly bad in OP scores. We were the worst in 12 years and were beaten by LOTS of co-ed and public schools... So you can never tell. 
In saying that my sister really enjoyed going to an all girls school. Her year went really well too. Ask your daughters what they would prefer... 
Btw, I work at a co-ed school at the moment and the kids there get on just fine.
