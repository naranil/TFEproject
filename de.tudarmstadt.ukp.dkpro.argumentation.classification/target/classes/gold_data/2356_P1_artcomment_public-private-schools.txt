As a parent that sent her son to private schools, I feel this is totally wrong for her to make this judgment.  My husband and I (my parents too!) sacrificed a lot to give him this education.  As far as public schools go, WOW are you sure that your child will come home to you tonight??????   I would NEVER put my child in a public school system if I could place them in a private.  So, come up with a different way to make the public systems in better shape!   Tina
