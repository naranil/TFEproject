One year of English? Yikes! CA is ranked one of the worst states in primary/high school education and I believe 4 yrs of English is required for graduation. Also, 3 yrs of social science, 2 yrs math, 2 yrs science, 2 yrs physical education, 2 yrs foreign language, health, geography, and 1 year of fine art. 
** I am going off my ODD's school requirement which is a public charter school. I am not sure if these standards are statewide or not.
