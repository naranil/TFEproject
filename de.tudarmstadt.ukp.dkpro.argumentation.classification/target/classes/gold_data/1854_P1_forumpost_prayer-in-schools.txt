1) There's no reason to suspect it matters. It is wasting valuable school time.
2) The 1st amendment clearly establishes (heh heh get it) that the government may not sponsor a religion. There are many religions that do not pray to their gods, and some that don't have any gods whatsoever. 
3) Not only that, but the 1st amendment has been interpreted to mean that the government may not sponsor religion in general. Prayer is solely religious in nature. 
4) It forces children to think that religion is okay. It's not.
5) Religion is a touchy issue. There is no need to politicize the classroom any more than it already has been. 
6) Children are impressionable. Forcing prayer upon them is tantamount to removing their ability to decide for themselves whether they would like to be an atheist or not. 
7) Dowant a fiery southern baptist leading your child in, say, non-Catholic prayers?
8) How many denominations should it encompass? Should there be separate prayers for Mormons, LDS, Muslims, Catholics, and Cult of Cthulhu adherents? 
9) In order for the prayers to be led by someone trained in leading prayers, one would have to hire ministers. This is costly. 
10) What if a child dissents? What if the child's parents dissent? This could lead to costly court battles, or more children entering into inadequate homeschooling programs. I am a victim of this latter possibility. Believe me, I'm still trying to repair the damage.
