Shes sounds like the kind of liberal hack i expect on this site. A child's degree of education is the purview of the parent. If I have the means to insure my children get a proper education then thats my choice. Also most schools got rid of vocational programs that are sorely needed . Not every kid can handle the material at college and to force them to try creates an economic burden on themselves and society. I would rather the child go learn engine repair or welding., Both of which tend to pay better then regular four degree jobs.
