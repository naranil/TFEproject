First off, I apologize if I'm posting in the wrong section. In our school, we recently had a debate about public schools and it was quite interesting, and I thought I'd see what some other debaters thought about this issue. 
The Topic went something like this: Public schools are not needed anymore, and they should all be turned into private institutions. 
Discuss :)
