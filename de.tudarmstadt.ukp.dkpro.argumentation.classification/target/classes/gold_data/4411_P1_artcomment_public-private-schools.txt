There is no secret to the rise of private schools. I have taught in private and public schools for 25 years and private schools have: 
1. More resources 2. More respect for students and teachers 3. More accountability for students and teachers. Australians are not mistaken - unfortunately the private system is miles ahead. 
Naturally, if a school has the power to select and expel students at will, it's easier teaching there. I have a few acquaintances who couldn't manage to teach successfully at public high schools in Western Sydney and went to the private system for a relatively easy life. Many others, however, persisted in the more difficult environment and added immense value to disadvantaged students. I know which I respect more. And what are we supposed to do with the many children who have learning difficulties, behaviour problems or specific disabilities? Put them in junior workhouses? I'm all right Jack...bugger you is a great attitude, especially for a teacher.
