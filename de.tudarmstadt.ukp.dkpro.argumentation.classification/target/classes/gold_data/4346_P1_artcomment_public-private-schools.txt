Socialism 101 - everyone must have everything the same. Those that work hard to be successful and have a better life do not deserve to reap the rewards of that success - they must share it with everyone. Sorry, that's not the principles this once great country was founded on, and it does not foster ambition in anyone. Why work hard if you have to give most of it away to those who choose not to.   And, perhaps more people should worry about the liberal indoctrination of our children in the public school system. If that were not a very real danger, then more people would consider sending their children to the cesspool that is now our public school system. Besides, private school should not be anyone's worry - it is home schooling that is becoming the trend. People who care about their children and our country are realizing it is parents' job to teach and raise children - not daycare and the government sanctioned liberal indoctrination warehouses you people try to pass off as education.
