If there's a demand for single-sex schools, those should be an option available to families. No student should be *ASSIGNED* to a single-sex school against his/her will, but I'm all in favor of voluntary selection into one. 
I would much prefer my children attend single-sex high schools to cut down on the distraction factor.
