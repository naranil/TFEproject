Do you seriously think the answer is that simple?  I had my child in public schools for K-3rd grade.  He has learning difficulties and I spent a good part of my work day emailing, calling and begging the school to do what had been agreed and contracting to for him.  It was about as successful as beating my head up against the wall.  We moved him - at great financial expense - to a private school that specializes in his learning difficulties ... not because we wanted to, but because we had exhausted everything else, short of suing the school system. Allison Benedikt needs to pull her head out of the clouds and come back down to earth where the real people live and struggle with the failing school systems.  Do I want to keep my child in private school costing a small fortune?  NO, but I want to give him every advantage possible to succeed.   Now, on the other hand, I believe I should get a voucher for the private school for the money the school system logs on their website that they pay for each child - since I still have to pay taxes!
