I went to a private Catholic school all through elementary school and then I was sent to an all girl private Catholic High School.  I despised school so much that I refused to go to college. I have 4 children, one of them went to private Catholic School and graduated high school.  She is a professor. Two of them went to private Catholic elementary school, but went to public high school.  My oldest son is Lt. William Silverberg in the air force and is a pilot My younger son is currently applying to Medical School to become a Surgeon. My last child went to public school only all the way until she graduated high school. She is currently in college and is studying Psychology. Those are the facts...nothing says I am a perfect parent, I am a product of the 70's and have made many mistakes.  I think it matters that you teach your children to be the best they can be at whatever they do!
