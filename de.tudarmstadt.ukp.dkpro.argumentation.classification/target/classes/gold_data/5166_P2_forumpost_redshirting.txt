to clarify red-shirting is PURPOSELY keeping them out - even if they make the cut off.
There is no way kids could start "younger and younger" - but totally possible kindy could become a room full of 6 and 7 year olds, then you have a kid who starts at a normal age - and he's inclass with kids 1 1/2 years older.
