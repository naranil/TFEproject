I don't understand why the children aren't allowed to enroll in public school. I don't have a problem with parents wanting to home school their children, but once the child reaches a certain age they should be permitted to makes some decisions with regards to their schooling, including attending local schools. The fact that the County refuses to do more with regards to the Powell children, in spite of the evidence that their education is lacking, is appalling to me. And if Mr. Powell is going to continue to educate the children at home he needs to get someone to help him.
