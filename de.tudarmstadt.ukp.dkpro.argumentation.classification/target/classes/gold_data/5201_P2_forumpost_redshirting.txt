You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids. Every once in a while a child might stand out but it's not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem "older" or "younger" 
you cant' because they adapt to their peers. A few stand out, and those I wonder why thy don't get bumped up to the grade they belong in, but others, including even my own YDD ... I think that being surrounded by younger kids slows down their own maturing because they want to fit in with the kids they are around. YDD's milestones since starting school have been consistantly a almost year behind when ODD did them ... washing hair, cutting harder foods, getting past the baby talk... 
And academics too. We had educational testing done because of issues the past few years. YDD tested high on vocabulary but her math and reading, she tested average on grade level (meaning compared to other kids just finished 3rd grade) but low on AGE level (9 yrs and 7 months). BTW - her "issues" affected her fluency, not her ability to learn. That's just my personal experience. From helping in classrooms, no by looking you can't tell the difference between most of the kids. But I do think that much of that is because the average kid is going to adjust to their surroundings. Just as you can nurture higher abilities of your child, you can stunt them too.
