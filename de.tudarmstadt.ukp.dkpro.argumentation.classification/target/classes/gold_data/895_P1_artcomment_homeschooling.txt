The issue with home schooling is that while it might be an alternative option for those parents attentive enough to care about the development of their child and have the will for them to reach their full potential, it is also an available option for those parents whose input into their child's life is simply that they bred. 
What of those children whose parents couldn't care less about their child, or whose child plays truant? Can they not then choose to 'home educate'? 
While many home educators are very supportive of their children, taking them to clubs etc where their child can socialise (read more on parentcentre.gov.uk)there are also children who are entirely unaccounted for as they have never been to school and are therefore not known by any local authority (especially if they move a lot). What of their education? 
Additionally, home educators in my research appear to believe that they have the best means to educate their child, ignoring all the professional qualifications, checks and standards that have been worked at over the years. Not perfect, no, but better than unchecked parents teaching, or guiding as some like to put it, in any way they please. Not all parents are the same, not all parents are equipped to help their children grow, but all of them can choose to home educate. 
The other thing to remember is that your child has to one day enter into a society where there are many different cultures, ideas, lifestyles etc that they would come into contact with if they went to a state school. If they are either only getting your perspective on life, or socialising in one demographic of society, then that's surely not as good for them as sending them to state school? 
That is why I agree with checks on home educators.
We have to work together, as a society. One day someone's child will be my doctor, my MP, my councillor, a voter. Don't you think I have a right to know at least a bit about what they are learning?
