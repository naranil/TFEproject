I completely agree with the author, in fact I have been saying the same thing for years.   I also feel that tax breaks for private school tuition should not be allowed.  We all need to support our public schools, as it benefits everyone.  The argument that public schools are poorly run and lacking in spite of increasing taxes is a copout.  A child's education is a joint effort, especially these days.  We can't rely only on the teachers and administrators to supply that.  It does also require parental participation at home, at school and on the school boards.  And like it or not, the people most willing and able to do that often decide to send their children to private school, because it is easier. That said, I also have strong feelings about tenure and teacher burnout.  But the more we take away from public schools, the worse things will get.
