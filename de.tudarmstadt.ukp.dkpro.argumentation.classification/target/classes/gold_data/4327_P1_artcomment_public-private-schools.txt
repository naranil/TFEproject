I think this writer is flat wrong.  We had our kids in public schools for years and went to the school board meetings, etc., etc.  From what I have seen the school boards have an attitude that parents are a problem and the board and the NEA knows what is best for our kids.  I have seen a packed house meeting with all parents advocating against a policy and then they go ahead and vote for the policy anyway.  It's a joke to think that just because wealthy parents send kids there it will be different.  There are always some exceptions, but generally, the school boards and teachers get their marching orders from the NEA....parents are only given the "illusion" of participation in the process.
