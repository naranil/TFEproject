Rich kids are not the only kids who go to private schools. My two kids went to private school and I worked extra to afford tuition. I would do it again. Many of the kids were on financial scholarships, not vouchers. The school was a religious school which we were of the same belief and values as the school. Because I was able to send my kids to a private school, I am a bad person. Why don't parents who desire to send their kids to private school work a little harder to improve their income, instead of complaining and expecting this country to come down to their level. If I remember my economic class, taxes pay for schools, and all parents of private kids pay taxes. So we are paying twice for kids education;  private and public!!!
