The Catholic schools ( which anyone can attend for the same cost the public school cost the tax payers) were formed because their values and believes were being undermined by the people in charge of the public schools. The public schools force them out. Here is another socialist wanting to rewrite history, forgot the past and indoctrinate the young their distorted believes.. And since most board of educations members are there to get their agenda through and could care less what anyone else wants.
