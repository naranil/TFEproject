This is the same idiot who wrote about how burdensome her dog is & how much less she loves him since she squeezed out 3 kids (who, at the time of the blog, were all under the age of 4).  She's a MORON.  A self-indulged, obnoxious twit who has little understanding of life in general.  So you turned out "OK,"  good for you.  Not every kid is that lucky & parents who put "the greater good" above that of their own children are bad parents.  There is no reason a parent can't send their kid to private school and help improve the public school in their district, either by volunteering or being on the school board.  It's likely that all of the people she knows who send their kids to private school are bad people, but that's probably because she surrounds herself with jerks (a reflection on her).  I personally know some very good people and parents who send their kids to private school.
