I am sorry, I am a hardliner on this. If you fail to get your kids educated in our SHARED knowledge base to a high school level, you are guilty of child abuse. You are assigning your kids to a life of poverty, opening them up to abuse and cutting them off from their potential. 
All schools should be accredited by at least the state level government and you should not be legally allowed to drop out until you are 16 years old.
