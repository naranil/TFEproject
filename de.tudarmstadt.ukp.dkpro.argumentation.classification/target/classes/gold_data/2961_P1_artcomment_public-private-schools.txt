I want my child to have a education that supports my religious beliefs and reinforces what I teach at home. Since you can no longer pray at school or discuss God, I choose to raise my child with my beliefs and send her to a private school.    I support public school with my taxes and do help the public schools by lowering their class size with one less child.
