Maybe I missed it, but does this writer have children?  Luckily we live in a good public school district and my step daughter does attend public school.  The public school she attends is #4 in the nation of public High Schools.  If we lived just a few miles down the road she would be in one of the worst school districts.  Parents should do what they feel is best for their children.  We rent in order to keep her in this district as we could never afford to purchase a home here.  We will put our dreams of owning a home on hold until she reaches College.  My sister and her husband worked two jobs in order to keep their kids in private school for the quality education.  When the kids transferred to Public High School they were leaps and bounds ahead of the other children in class.
