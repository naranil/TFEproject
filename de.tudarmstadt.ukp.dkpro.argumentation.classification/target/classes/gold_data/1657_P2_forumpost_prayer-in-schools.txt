No, the state -can- infringe upon religious -acts-. The establishment clause provides that government shall not establish an official religion. The free exercise clause only seems to cover freedom to hold religious beliefs. Religious -acts-, on the other hand, are subject to state regulation. Laws against polygamy are subject to state regulation because the state claims that polygamy is in direct conflict with its interests. Other acts (like animal sacrifices) also appear to be subject to state regulation. 
"If a particular law impedes “religious” activity even indirectly, it violates free exercise clause of this amendment, unless impediment is justified by compelling state interest arising from some substantial threat to public health, safety, peace, or order, and is the least restrictive means for protecting the compelling state interest. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Lukhard, C.A.4 (Va.) 1984. 
State may justify its infringement of religious liberty if it is necessary to accomplish overriding governmental interest. Scott v. Rosenberg, C.A.9. (Cal.) 1983. 
If law is not neutral and of general applicability, government may justify its infringement on particular religious practice only by demonstrating that the infringement is narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest. Rader v. Johnston, D.Neb.1996. 
In determining whether law violates Free Exercise Clause, if law is not neutral and of general applicability, then law must be justified by compelling governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest. Phelps v. Hamilton, D.Kan.1993." U.S.C.A. Amend. 1
