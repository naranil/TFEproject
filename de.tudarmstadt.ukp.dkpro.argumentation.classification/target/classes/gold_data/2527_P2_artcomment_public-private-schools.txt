I went to public schools, in Baltimore City, MD. They have consistently ranked in the bottom for decades. I currently send my own sons to public school (they have also attended private/religious schools in the past), one that is just recently improving and offering more AP courses in AZ.  I am a highly successful professional, went on the earn multiple college degrees and certifications. My sons are also excelling and I could not be prouder of their efforts.  Education is a private choice, but I have found that regardless of whether you attend public or private schools (I have met total losers, drug addicts and criminals from BOTH public and private schools) the outcome depends on the support the parent (s) provide at home. A child will imitate mom and dad. If mom and dad are supportive, educated and active in the child's progress, the child will do well and go on to be successful. The school is irrelevant. These parents demanding isolation of their kids from "the bad people" are not helping them. To be successful in life, children need exposure and interaction with all types of people, different skin color, religions, values in order to create their own identity and be prepared for what lies ahead when they are on their own at college and future jobs. Ultimately, mom and dad, you are your child's compass, not whatever school you choose to place them in. Take charge of your child's education, you will only see good outcomes.
