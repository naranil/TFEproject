Home schooling does not have to be the enemy, but those who home school must be educated enough themselves to provide a good education for their children. If they are just reading a religious text and not studying math, science, history and the like, then parents are doing a disservice to their children. If they are just going to stay at home and not engage in society then maybe they will do ok, but they will not be able to compete in the larger society. Home schooling works when there are some standards. Parents can incorporate their religion into the mix. We need to work together on this instead of name calling.
