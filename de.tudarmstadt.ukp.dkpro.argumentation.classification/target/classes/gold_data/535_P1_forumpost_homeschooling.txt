It's not wrong to hold the opinoin that in general it's better for kids to go to school than to be homeschooled. It's an opinion. I have reasons behind it. And I never said that I think all homeschoolers are like the Duggars or all socially awkward, just that the overall "School" experience to me is very important for development of all children, and to me, that can't be entirely replicated at home. Do I still think a decent majority of homeschoolers do it for reasons like sheltering kids, religion, wanting to keep control on kids, special snowflake syndrome, etc? Yes I do. I'm sorry but I do. Do I judge all families that choose to homeschool based on that? No way. Especially not here where there are a lot of highly intelligent people who break the mold IMO for "Every day" mothers in lots of ways. But in general, I don't think I could ever be convinced that it's "wrong" for me to be anti-homeschool. Honestly there are likely a lot more people that feel the way I do it's just not something popular to speak out about here.
