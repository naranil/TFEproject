I have a right as an American to send my children to private school and by the way we are not rich by ant means. Public schools are not influenced by parents, that's hooey. Public schools are help hostage by state and federal govenments. Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators they have no control over curriculum, what happens in the classroom, discipline, or anything else. How would you feel about you 6th grade daughter being in the classroom with a 17 year old predator ? How would you feel about your child having to endure being bullied and taunted daily and when he reports it to the teacher nothing is done to the bully but your kid gets the snot beaten out of him ? And when you complain you will be told that there are procedures that must be followed. My children went to Catholic School so they could receive a religious education, attend mass daily, be safe, and learn. By the way I taught in the public schools for over twenty-five tears. I retired because I could no longer stand seeing children who desperately wanted to learn being thwarted by disruptive hoodlums. What experrience do you have dear? Bless your heart.
