Another liberal that blame the rich for all the problem of the country!  The evil rich who create jobs, invest so companies might expand and pay (a lot ) of taxes!     Why is it the Rich should always "fix" it! How about it starts at home and stop voting for these liberal policies!   Personal responsiability would do a lot to start the fix but these liberals want to blame someone else !    They get out tax money anyhow so if all the "rich" kids went back to public schools they would be short of teachers the schools to small so we would have to raise taxes some more to get new ones !    I do not blame folks that are voting against tax increases as the liberals with there tax increases are forcing the poor, middle class and retired to be forced to  move out of there house for not being able to afford the taxes !
