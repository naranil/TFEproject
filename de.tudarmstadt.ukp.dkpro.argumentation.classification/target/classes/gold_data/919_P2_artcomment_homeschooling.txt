I do find it rather annoying that many commenters here would rather talk about what a bad idea they think homeschooling is. They are free to do that, of course, but it's rather off topic, isn't it? 
The article was about how new rules may be unfair to people who wish to homeschool. Whether they should be homeschooling in the first place is not exactly the point -- and a choice that's up to them, as well.
