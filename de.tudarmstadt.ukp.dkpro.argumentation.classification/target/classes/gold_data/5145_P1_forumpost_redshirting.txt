I know several people who said that they wish their parents had waited a year to send them to kindergarten. DH was 4 when he started school and was only 17 when he graduated from HS. He hated that everyone was doing everything a year before he could do it. He was very good at sports though, even though he was a year younger than anyone else on his team. 
I honestly made my decision because I had a choice and I just did not feel right personally about sending my DS to Kindergarten at age 4. Last year the cut off was October 9th I believe and this year it has been changed to July 1st. DS's birthday is August 30th. 
I did not wait to send DS because I wanted him to have an edge over anyone. Age has nothing to do with ability and if he were the type who would struggle, he would struggle regardless of when he started school. I do not compare my children with other people's children. I do what is best for my children and assume other parents do what is best for their children. 
Age wise I was right in the middle of my class at school and I was far ahead of my class. I don't think age really dictates how well you will do in school or in sports.
