SUPPORT MY LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL GUESS WHAT MY TAXES DO THAT FOR ME  WITH OUT ASKING !! There was a time we were okay to put our children in public school. That time no longer exists !! Not even based on the fact that what is there teaching our kids aren't worth discussing (The good ole saying of those who can, do and those who can't TEACH)!  TRY THINKING OF THE SECURITY ISSUES WE HAVE!! The teachers have the right to misuse and abuse the system and our children anyway they want and get away with it because of the F*** teachers union.  We have shooters walking in every year most are students sick and damn tired of the abuse they get  from the school itself ! NOT THAT IT MAKES IT RIGHT FOR WHAT THEY DID OR GIVES AN EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY DO!!  But the argument is based on public or private. I'm not saying that it can't happen in a private school setting but I do feel safer having my children in that setting over public. The abuse from other children that we sit and hear about until one child has taken his or her own life because the school has refused to do anything about the bullying even though they have a 0 tolerance rule!! Truth of the matter is I wouldn't want to teach in a public school either!  The kids who are in the schools with no one at home teaching right from wrong. No manners, morals,respect for others!! No one to set higher grounds for them. Don't let them fool you though!! The private schools have dumb their education and standards down so much they are not much better however there is still a difference. My kids come home happy from school, they get up in the mornings typical kids moaning and groaning about having to get up early but they don't fear going. They don't sit in class with gangsters and Liberal  Obama voting teachers forcing them to learn their way or no way!  They are given rights to make choices and argue points and think for themselves. They can God Bless someone from a sneeze or hug a friend without it being rape! We can put up Christmas Trees and celebrate things with out worrying about being sued. Parents are welcome to be apart of the system instead of it being hidden from us. We have a peace of mind when pulling away from dropping our kids off knowing they are going to be okay!
