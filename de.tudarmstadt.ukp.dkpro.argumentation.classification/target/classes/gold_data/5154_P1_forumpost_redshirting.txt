I swear if I hear one more time (and I know I will) about how advanced her kid is ... I'm just going to say "so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs?" 
Oooo - I had to bite my tongue to keep from saying almost the same thing, in a similar situation recentl!. I have a July '07 girl whom I am sending to kindergarten this fall. I got into a conversation with another mom whose child was the same age, who was holding her daughter back. She was actually totally cool, said she was still kind of conflicted about her decision, respected others choices, etc. 
It was the other women there who jumped into our conversation and assured her that she was DEFINITELY doing the right thing, who annoyed me. It went unsaid, but the message I got was that I was not doing the right thing, by sending mine. The example one of them gave was, "My neighbor held back her child, and now she's in first grade, and reading at a 4th grade level!" And I thought, sure, because she's a bright kid who's supposed to be in 2nd grade. But I didn't say it.
