When you have an entire citizenry that has been raised to hate unto death their families, their neighbors and each other, then anybody with a brain in their heads is deemed "different" -- and not in the good way. Our entire society is based upon hate. Our government is based upon hate. Our entire public school system is nothing but a battleground controlled by hate and a hatred that is enforced by bullies. Knowledge is power. Knowledge is the only thing that will save you. The best education is the only route to go; and it isn't in a public school system.
