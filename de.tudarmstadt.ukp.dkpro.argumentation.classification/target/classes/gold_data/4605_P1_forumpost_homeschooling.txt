I'm on the same page as FedUp. My kids won't go to public schools for a lot of reasons. We do have a lot of private schools around us, we are starting to look into the cost, as ODD is now 3 we figured we should start looking into it. I agree that HS isn't what it used to be, there are a lot more resources. I don't know if I agree that a parent has to be super organized, so much as motivated. (though organization does help.) I've known people who were HS where their parents didn't really teach them all that much. I think that as a parent you really have to commit to x amount of hours a day HAVE to be designated for school, and it is really easy to be like "Well, we'll get back on track tomorrow." A little flexibility like that is fine but I think it would be easy to go over board.
