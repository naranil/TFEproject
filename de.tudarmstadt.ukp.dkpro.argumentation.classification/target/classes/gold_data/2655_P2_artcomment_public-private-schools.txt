It is no one's business where someone decides to send their children to school or for what reason. I resent someone saying because I send my children to a private school I am hurting the public system. I have taught in both private and public schools.  I have witnessed a much more  disciplined approach in the private system, and children  learn better when not distracted by children who have not experienced  proper authority. Not all public schools are bad and not all private schools are good. I should be allowed to choose according to my own standards without criticism.
