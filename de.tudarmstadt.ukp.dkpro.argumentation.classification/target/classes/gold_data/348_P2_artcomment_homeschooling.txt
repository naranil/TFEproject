The religious exemption is the issue because it is this and this only that doesn't require accountability in VA. I have friends that home schooled in VA for non-relgious reasons, and the kids had to take SOLs at their respective grade levels. 
Why is it okay that students home schooled for religious reasons never have to prove they can read or add, via the most basic SOLs at even the 3rd grade level? Why does VA see a different criteria for religious exemption home schooling and just general reasons to home school? 
It will be interesting to see how this case progresses.
