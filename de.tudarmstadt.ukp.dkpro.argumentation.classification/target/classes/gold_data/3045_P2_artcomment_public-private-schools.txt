Dumb-so you are supposed to sacrifice your child so a school can get better?  No thank you. Here's an idea make the school good first and then parents will send their kids there.  I picked an area to live in that has excellent public schools.  I didn't pick a place to live that has bad schools so I could make it better.  If an area wants to attract high performing students with supportive parents then spend time, money, and effort to make it the best school it can be.  If you build it the people will come.  If your school sucks parents aren't going to sacrifice their kids so they can help start a PTA program,etc.
