Testimony: My son, now 25, was held back by going to Transitional first grade (T1). Not sure how it would have turned out if we'd sent him straight through, but I can attest that he is a leader in all things he does – athletically, professionally, and socially. He was awarded a full athletic college scholarship; voted captain of his team by his teammates for three years, and earned another scholarship to get his masters; and had several generous job offers to choose from upon graduating. I believe that his going the T1 route was a part of what worked for us. I know it's a tough decision to make – best of luck to those trying to make the decision, I know its tough and is different for each child.
