If I am a bad person for sending my child to private school, well you are just plain dumb to think that.  I am not wealthy but I have changed my lifestyle to afford for my child to go to private school.  My child is allowed to pray in school, unlike public schools.  This writer needs to visit a public high school in my area (and you may want to wear a bullet proof vest for your safety) and maybe she will reconsider her article.
