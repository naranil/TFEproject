@oommph - here you get to a sensitive subject - modern science contains hardly any proper science, just compare the exam papers from the past decade with those from the 70s and 80s. You're also making the mistake of directly comparing discrete subjects from school with a more broad-based approach used by home educators. We teach our children how to learn, not merely how to pass tests. My 8yr-old is already enjoying our sessions with basic physics and chemistry textbooks, books which are generally used at the start of secondary school. He's interested now, so we cover the subject now and he'll learn it much quicker because of that interest. 
Also consider that school is about 25% efficient, so of the five hours a day of nominal lesson time, you lose a fair bit in disruptions, admin, not understanding (or not listening to) the topic and having it explained again, finishing the exercise and waiting while it's explained again to someone else, etc. Home education doesn't take long holidays like school does, so if you work it out, the 250 useful hours of learning at school during a year is easily matched and exceeded by home educators who are doing low-key, low-pressure teaching all the time. We've even done addition and subtraction exercises on a flight home from a holiday before now, and in a Parliamentary committee room one evening, so you can see we're all quite flexible about learning.
