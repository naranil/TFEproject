Just a thought - the way it works in my community is REAL ESTATE TAXES fund our public schools. Therefore I am not taking ANYTHING away from the public school system by sending my sons to private school. As a matter of fact, as a homeowner, I am supporting both systems, much more than those less fortunate can. I am all for the public school system.  I was a product of the public school system, and yes, they are very necessary.  I believe everyone deserves an education, and much more than the 12 years we get, but I also believe I have a choice to do what I feel is best for my children!
