Redshirting a trend? This is insane! These kids need to be prepared for the 21st centuary global economy by being enrolled in a local second language immersion kindergarden as soon as they can enroll. This is because language acquisition therories tell us that, "there is a window of opportunity in which the child learns that first language normally. After this period, the brain becomes slowly less plastic and by the time the child reaches adolescence, the brain cannot develop "richly and normally any real cognitive system, including language." http://www.cal.org/earlylang/benefits/research_notes.html As Larry The Cable Guy would say: "Only in America!"
