l think as parents of the child you have to be certain and confident that your child is ready to mainstream. lf not, it can backfire on the child. My child was in "preschool handicapped" from age 2-5. We tried to mainstream him in kindergarten, but he had a hard time adjusting. So the school got him a one on one para and it helped a bit. 2 grades later, he still has a one on one aide but doing EXCELLENT. 
Our goal is for him to not have a one on one by middle school. We took him off meds and we have a strong behavior plan, he sees therapists, and it is hourly teaching and redirecting with him. Truth be told College may not be in his future, but we will do everything in our power to try to get him there.
