It always makes me crazy when an editor allows the submission of what amounts to nothing more than just random keystrokes assembled in a "perfectly crappy" manner.   No logic, no argument, no facts - just a moronic, wandering piece of blather.  If you're bad to send your kids to a private school then are you a deputy of the devil himself if you take your kids to private lessons for whatever talent they may have that will be ignored in the public system?    Ms. Benedikt does nothing here but show her need for schooling in the very most basic of basics with regard to construction of a logical and meaningful statement of opinion.  And of course, the same applies to the editor who allowed her piece to be shared.
