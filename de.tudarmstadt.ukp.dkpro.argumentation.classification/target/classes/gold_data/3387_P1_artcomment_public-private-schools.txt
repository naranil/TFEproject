If I had the money, wealthy or not, I'd send my kids to a private school.  That way I'd ensure they would have a quality, moral based education not this liberal B...S... the public schools ram down kids throats today.  Unfortunately I have been unemployed for some time now and buying food for my kids is a higher priority.   Making the asinine statement that sending all kids to a public school will make the schools better is the result of someone who has gone to public school and is a complete idiot.
