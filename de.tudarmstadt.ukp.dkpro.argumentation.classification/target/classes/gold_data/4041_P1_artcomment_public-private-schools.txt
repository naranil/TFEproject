I had several issues with the public education system not being able to keep up with my son who happened to be 3 grades ahead of his age level. Many conversations with the Principal and teachers. He began to start not caring about school itself, he was very bored. I ended up pulling him out in 5th Grade into to private education through High School. I made 7.50/hr and was able to get an income based grant through the school. It was the best investment I had made.
