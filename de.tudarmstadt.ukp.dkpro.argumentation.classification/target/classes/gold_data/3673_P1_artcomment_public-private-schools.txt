Total and complete BS. My son was tossed around public school written off as a bad kid because he has high function autism and bipolar disorder. Only when he started a private school did he learn and grow mentally emotionally and socially. Public school does need a full and complete do over but don't tisk parents that make a conscious decision to send there kid to private school. Most parents that try to make a diff are not heard. I was one of them. I had to involve the state and district physiatrist just to get results on proper schooling. I got lucky I had one person in my son's school admin on my side, most single parents don't get squat for help from the schools. Usually the school admin try to blame the parent for not being involved enough when all the parent is trying to do is make sure their kids get proper education!
