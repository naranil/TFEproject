Maybe your right but it is not a risk I'm willing to take. My child will suffer and or fall behind while I'm fighting the system. I'll just have to be a bad parent that pays taxes so that the other children can benefit from public school education or not, meanwhile my child's chances of success are higher with minimal risk of failing schools.
