So...let's see if I have this straight:  I can afford to send my child to a private school (which I don't by the way), but I should forego this option in the hope that my kid attending public school will raise up the school, making it better for other kids? What a pile of crap!  My job is to prepare my child as best possible to grow to be a responsible, productive adult.  My tax dollars already go to fund public schools so I am not shirking a financial obligation when choosing private school. Sending my child to an underperforming school does not maximize his chances to succeed, even with my active participation.  Thus, I am reducing his opportunities for a pipe dream. Seems to me the author should be a huge proponent of school vouchers.  These programs allow choice for parents and encourage schools to improve so they may get more of the available education dollars
