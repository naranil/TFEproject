The author completely misses the reason why I send my children to private school as well as how to help the education system as a whole.  I am a loving, knowledgeable, intelligent and successful individual that wants to do all that I can to prepare my children and give them a great life.  My decision was based solely on those points as found by our exhaustive research of what was available to us in our area.  Unfortunately that has me paying for my children to attend private school, and me paying for BOTH types of education.  I pay taxes that go to the local school system that my children don't attend on both my residential property and business properties and I pay the private school tuition.  I think the best way to get Public schools to be better and for the system to be fairer is for parents to be given vouchers for the amount public schools would receive for your child's education and for the parents to have a choice of where to send their children.  Public schools will never get better until they have competition.  It is time we stop rewarding a bad system, and reform it with the good old reward system that promotes doing better called competition.
