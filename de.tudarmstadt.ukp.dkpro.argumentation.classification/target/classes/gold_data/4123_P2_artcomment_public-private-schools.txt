This is liberalism taken to another level!  Since all of us (including the "wealthy" parents who pay to send their kids somewhere else) are paying the teachers and administrators' salaries in these crappy schools with our tax dollars, do you think that it might just be reasonable for us to ask them to do their job and clean it up themselves??  Now our enlightened friends at MSNBC are suggesting that its up to "wealthy" parents to do it instead??   How about changing the teacher's union rules so they get paid for performance like everybody else?  And if its a problem with the caliber of the student, then lets start a discussion about family values and single Moms and deadbeat Dads who keep having children who they don't care about enough to raise them properly.  Al and Jesse are not interested in talking about that.  Teachers don't have to be incompetent and children who come from families who aren't "wealthy" don't have to have bad behavior and zero motivation.   How about an article on the cultural problem all of you "progressive" thinkers?
