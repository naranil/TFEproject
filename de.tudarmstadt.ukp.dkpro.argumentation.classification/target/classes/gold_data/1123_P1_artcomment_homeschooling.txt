The topic of home schooling is a difficult one, whilst in some circumstances it is the most appropriate way for a child to learn, and it seems that many of you who post here who have experience of home schooling are very dedicated and are doing a great job, in other circumstances, I don´t think that it is appropriate, and through a lack of parental ability/knowledge of the area, it may not be the best thing for the child. 
I have recently had a conversation with my mother about home schooling as a family friend has taken this approach, and she feels that in our circumstances, it would have been impossible for her to home school me as she has always worked full time, and in certain fields, doesn´t think she would have had appropriate skills to comment or help me with the work that needed to be done. 
It is my personal belief, although many of you will disagree, that in the majority of cases, a child is best in school, being able to mix with a greater number of students, and take part in extra curricular activities. Jemmo suggests that 
which was not my experience of school at all. There were around 200 students in my year, and my classes were mixed with a variety of them, not just a particular form of thirty. In addition, the extra curricular/sports activities brought together students from all the different year groups, enabling us to mix and interact with both older and younger students. 
To respond to this particular article, I don´t think anyone is particularly trying to blame home education for this particular case. However, I don´t see anything wrong with a registration system where the quality of education is monitored periodically - the authors express concern that home eduation is totally different to school education and so they may be judged by `"people who do not know what they are judging," but given the increasing popularity of home education, would it not be possible for education professionals who do understand home education to be able undertake tasks like this? (I don't know if it would be, this is a genuine question, are there enough people in the system with knowledge of home education to be able to implement such a scheme as this?)
