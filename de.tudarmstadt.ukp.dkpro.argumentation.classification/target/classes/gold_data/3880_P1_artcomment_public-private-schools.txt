Well--I'm already paying for Public Schools via my taxes and the varying tax levies on top of sending my children to private school. I'm paying TWICE! I pay my taxes/ levies just like anyone else in my neighborhood who's children attend public school.  On top of that, my kids take their private education seriously and once-a-week, go to the inner city public schools and teach young students how to improve their reading.  Both the parents of private schooled children and our children themselves are doing our part to help the public schools. As other posters have stated. It's not the money, it's the politics behind the schools themselves, the lowered standards of education (our US math scores are abysmal) and the funding of GREAT teachers and discontinuing paying and boosting teachers that don't perform.
