The writer states, "there are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school", this should more properly have been stated, "there are a lot of bad reasons why people send their kids to private school".  The reasons may be deemed bad, but the people aren't.  They are only trying to do what is best for their kids, and they can afford it.  They also, at the same time, contribute more to the public schools through higher property taxes than do their detractors.  The main problems with public education are bad parents and teachers' unions.  It understandable if people do all they can to avoid both.
