Different regions are different I realize, but here they obviously feel the same way because the cut-off is now July 1st. Which means the child has to turn 5 by July 1st or they cannot start KG yet. So DS is starting right ON TIME. 
yeah but if that's the rule there then you are not redshirting. You are going with the guidelines. So this is not about you. Here the cut off is October and yet quite a few kids with birthdays in July through September are held back. THAT is redshirting.
