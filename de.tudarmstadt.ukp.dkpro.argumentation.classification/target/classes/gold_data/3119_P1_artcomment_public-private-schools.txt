Lets find out why parents choose certain private schools,,......1- less kids in the classroom, with opportunity to receive education more to a one on one basis. 2,- No nonsense attitude. You do work, you are compensated with words of praise. You don't, mom and dad will know about it and will expect parents' input and help. 3. Push for RESPECT, RESPECT, RESPECT.....the child is the student....the teacher is the instructor...PERIOD. 4- The teacher excels in helping children with disabilities...offers  help for children with extra needs......want me to keep going?  Now, if I take my child to a Public school she will be out of high school by the time the system changes......y child will loose...do I want this?
