Moderator, I hope you don't think this is too off-topic. I live in a village in Ontario where about 10% of the students in the local Public school are of First Nation origin. One day I took 7 posters to school which would be meaningful to these students in particular, but are respectful and positive to all. The posters portrayed the "Seven Grandfathers", which are the main values underlying aboriginal beliefs: Truth, Respect, Love, Bravery, Courage, Honesty, Wisdom, and Humility. The posters had tasteful pictures. I was told these posters were "too controversial" and the principal refused to post them. How ironic that these UNIVERSAL values are forbidden by the public school (presumably because they are associated with First Nations), but Muslim prayer services are endorsed. I don't get it.
