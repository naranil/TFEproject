I dunno, I was 18 in grade 12. Some friends were 17 but other's were 18 as well. Just remember, by the time they get to grade 12, there are many of them that started later or earlier and they are all integrated according to what classes they take. I don't think it is a big deal being 18 when graduating or 17. But maybe, that's just me... ;)
