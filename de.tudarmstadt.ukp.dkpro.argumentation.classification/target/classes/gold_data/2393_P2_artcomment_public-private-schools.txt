Asking teachers to be responsible for their students' academic failures is like asking firefighters to be responsible for their fire survivors' victimhood.  Are you kidding?  Teachers are responsible for teaching.  Firefighters are responsible for fighting fires.  No matter how many times firefighters may "teach" us to not "play" with fire, we do (and many fires break out).  Should we blame (or sue) our firefighters for our insistence on (or resistance to) not learning?  C'mon.  Jeez.  Parents of students are responsible for their own childrens' failures or successes. And, while I'm thinking about it, why do we USA folks think that parents should "take on" teachers' jobs?  I would no more have helped my son with his grade 9 math (that I couldn't do, let alone know how to teach) than my Belgium next-door neighbor wants to help her daughter with her English writing skills.  Let parents...parent.  Let teachers...teach. Let firefighters...fight the fires.  OF COURSE we should all help each other (and should--if we're capable), but most of us who are capable firefighters are not necessarily capable math teachers, and those of us who are capable parents are not necessarily capable teachers, and those of us... you get my drift. Sanity?  Logic, anyone?  Parent-involvement in schools is akin to teacher involvement in firefighting.  Let the trained professionals do their jobs (and let mommy and daddy--in whatever their respective trained work entails--do their jobs).  If one CAN (is able to) help (and is trained as a teacher, along with whatever OTHER job the parent may work at), then great.  Otherwise:?   (Don't we parents all love to think that professional teaching is easy?  Don't we parents all love to think that we are the "real" Dr. Mom or Dr. Dad?  So what if we don't have M.D.s?)  Gosh.  Gosh. ~Jayne
