My children cannot attend their local public school: it is completely dysfunctional, enforces no discipline, and is ruled by bullies and bad behaviour. More than 2/3 of those who complete their schooling fail to obtain a certificate. 
I therefore have to send my children to a nearby religious school where discipline is enforced, bullying is addressed, and academic standards are acceptable. 
If the government sector wishes to address its appalling reputation, it will need to ditch decades of trendy, anti-academic thinking that has resulted in this mess.
