There are some great studies coming out of Canada and are even being tried in some U.S. schools. The data indicates that children born Jan.-April outperform both physically and academically than their peers born May-Dec. It indicates that those born June-Dec. should be held back from kindergarten a year. Problem is too many parents want to ship them out sooner than later to eliminate day care expenses and having them around another year.
