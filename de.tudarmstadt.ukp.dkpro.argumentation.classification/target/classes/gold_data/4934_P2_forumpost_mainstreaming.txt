My lo has mild autism, he has only just been diagnosed, he is delayed in some areas (but not others), he goes to ms school, and has some one to one (this should increase now, I hope). There is one TA and a full time TA who supports another child with autism. It's a smallish school. 
He isn't disruptive (well he sometimes doesn't do as asked and can be a little akward), he has never been aggressive in anyway, he is very happy. 
I am worried about his future (high school)after reading this.
