The rational of this argument is not logical.  No one is to blame for poor public schools, except for the public schools.  The "entitlement" suggestion that it is always someone else's fault is simply without any plausible reason to support this claim.  In fact, it is very much ignorant.  There is no research to support this claim.  If a school is bad, then it is the people within the school that need to stand up and put the effort into changing it.  Also, there is no evidence that says "more money" will help a school improve.  It is the people that work there, their motivation, their ability to work together in a collaborative way, and their ability to strive for success and to teach resilience.  You can't blame someone else who isn't even there.   Goodness, goodness, we spend more time whining than simply working hard and doing a good job.
