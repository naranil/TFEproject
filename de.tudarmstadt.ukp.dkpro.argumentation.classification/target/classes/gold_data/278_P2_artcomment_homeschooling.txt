Even though the religious right doesn't like it, the fact is Thomas Jefferson was not a Christian but was a Deist. That is he believed in The Supreme Intelligence/God based on the application of his innate God-given reason on the laws and designs in Nature. Jefferson broke with tradition when he designed the University of Virginia without a chapel. Up to that time universities all had a church or chapel at their center. Jefferson's university had a library at its center.
