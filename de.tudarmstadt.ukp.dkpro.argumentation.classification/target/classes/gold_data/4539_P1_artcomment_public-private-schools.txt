A few points, the "perceived advantages" were hardly touched on in this article. I know there are some advantages at private schools, having gone to a woefully basic selective high school. 
Having said that, a private education is no guarentee of a job, nor that you will always have that job...I have seen plenty of people being shown the door in the corporate world for being incompetent, lazy. stupid, or getting their hand caught in the till.....the boss does not care where you went to school when it comes to firing for these "crimes". 
I am delighted with the education my kids are getting at a private Catholic school, for the fact that trouble makers are dealt with, resources are good, and it is hard to put into words, but someone is keeping an eye on them all the time. eg daughter in yr 10 decided not to do a science for yr 11, i received a call from her academic advisor about this, and how did i feel about the career choices she was shutting the door on. I really appreciated the call, as it meant someone genuinely cared about her future. 
would this happen in a state school? I doubt it, as there are not the funds for a full time academic advisor. 
Ditto, social justice and pastoral care. I recall two girls at my high school had a parent die. We were never formally told, we just swept it under the carpet...i still feel gulity for never saying "so sad for you, how can I help you now that you mum has died." At Private schools, a food roster is started, and kids are told to reach out..I know it may see, irrelevant, but people care more...for me, this is the perceived advantage of private schooling.
