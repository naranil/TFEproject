I would look at the subjects on offer. Sometimes single sex schools don't have the numbers (or enough interest) to run certain subjects for example â€“ girls schools may not run shop classes, boys schools may not run home-ec classes. Also, if girls schools don't have the interest/enough numbers to run advanced maths classes they may not offer it at all or only offer it as a correspondence subject. On the other hand, it can work in the girls' favour if they do run the class with a teacher and its a very small group.
