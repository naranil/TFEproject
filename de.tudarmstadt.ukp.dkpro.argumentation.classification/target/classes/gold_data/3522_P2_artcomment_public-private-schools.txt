Anyone that would force a person to use a public school when they want to use a private school is a bad person. If you really want to improve public education, stop treating it as an institution and start treating it as a business. Institute school vouchers where the money to educate each child goes with the child from school to school. If I pull my child from Edison Elementary, they lose the funding for my child. The funding would then go to whatever public school I choose. Additionally, If I choose to send my kid to private school, I get a school voucher worth up to 50% of the amount to educate a child in a public school (ie. public school costs $10K per child per year, property tax refund max = $5K), since my property taxes would then be wasted on a system I don't support. When a school discovers that poor performance can cost the school funding and possibly cost people their jobs, you'll see a turn around and responsiveness to parents in short order.
