We certainly are NOT wealthy, but we choose to send our children to a Catholic school where they can learn our faith as well as benefit from smaller class sizes and high academic expectations.  We enjoy being part of a very involved and caring school community.  We have shared one family car-a 7 year old Dodge mini-van and make many other financial sacrifices in order to make this possible for our children. I am happy to shop consignment stores and forego other luxuries such as vacations to give my kids the best possible education.
