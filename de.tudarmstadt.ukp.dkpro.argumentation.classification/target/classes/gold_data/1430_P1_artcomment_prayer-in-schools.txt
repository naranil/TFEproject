This is just silliness.
Fact: Muslims pray five times daily, in a way which is not practical in a normal classroom setting. 
Fact: we make other appropriate accommodations for other faith groups. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses commonly do not participate in the national anthem, because they only recognize the Kingdom of God. 
Both are reasonable accommodations. They do not impose significantly on the other traditions. I see no issue here. Nobody is being influenced here - Muslim students are simply being given a place to pray. I'm good with that.
