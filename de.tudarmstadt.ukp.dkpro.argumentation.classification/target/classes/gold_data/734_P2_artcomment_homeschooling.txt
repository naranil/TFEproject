Have you considered setting up a Charter School? I understand that a similar initiative is being proposed by the Coalition. 
These schools have been very successful in minority areas in the US, where local communities have been empowered by them. 
You'll remember, perhaps, the episode of the West Wing where the black Mayor persuades President Bartlett to support them, for this reason. They are the great liberal cause of our era, really.
