I was wondering when someone would mention Eunice Spry, who was a foster carer (lots of checks for that), whose children were abused while they were at school (isn't that meant to be the ultimate safety-net?) and who welcomed home inspections. She neatly demonstrates how totally pointless Badman's recommendations are! Sick abusers like her will still get away with it because they play ball and fool those set with the job of monitoring them. 
Victoria Climbie was neither home educated, nor 'unknown' and it is an insult to her memory to try excusing the professional who failed her by pretending that she was either! Read the Serious Case Review and then tell me how home education had anything to do with it. 
As for declining 'registration' being "pathetic and paranoid". Registration isn't what is being suggested, it's LICENSING. Registration would just mean saying "we're home educating" once and you're done, no home inspections, no proving your innocence on an annual basis, no plans of study, no testing. The DCSF choose to keep calling what they're after 'registration' to generate precisely your reaction, but that's because they're fundamentally dishonest scum.
