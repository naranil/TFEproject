I spend a good portion of my income on private (i.e. Christian) school, it is my religious belief and MY RIGHT. My kids have never been to Disneyland/world or Hawaii nor do they have smart phones and such. As other people already commented, we are indeed supporting the public schools by paying taxes and extending the life of the facilities and equipment by NOT using it.  The HUGE difference, already pointed out, is that in private schools, it is a majority group of parents who totally invest in their children in every aspect. There are lots of great parents who send their awesome kids to public schools, but many public schools unilaterally have to deal with the kids who basic needs of hygiene, food, sleep, clean clothes and even some TLC are not being met, despite the governments  many safety nets. And it shouldn't be the teachers job to fill in those gaps.  Therein les he discrepancy.  Does it really matter to the author of the article that my (and other private schools) turns out a few Bible thumping do-gooders in the world?
