Hi as far as I know they cant refuse to have a child just because they have special needs etc thats awful know you usually have to have a statement if applying to a school that wouldnt be the school that your child is nearest too [if out of the catchment area] would definately look into the links the other sharon gave you and parent partnership are great at helping with any queries good luck sharon
