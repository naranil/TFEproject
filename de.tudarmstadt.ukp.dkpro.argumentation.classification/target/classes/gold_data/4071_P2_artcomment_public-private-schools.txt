So we should all seek out the worst possible school to send our children to so this ****ing moron is happy? What about poor inner city schools that are infested with gang and gun culture? Drugs? One of the most idiotic statements I have ever heard. I'm guessing this moron either has no children or the schools in her district are A-Ok.
