I'm dumbfounded these parents would deny their children an education - or one that is so insufficient they require three years of remedial-college to simply be able to attend another 4 year university. What a waste of time and money and takes a very short view of life long goals of independence.. The father doesn't appear very well educated since he doesn't seem to have steady employment other than being a handyman of some sort. That's nice I suppose. And his wife appears to be so cowed she doesn't speak for herself. I find them both rather frightening. Seriously. You actively, with forethought, work to deny your child an education? Even when they beg this from you? Wow. 
Public school is what you and your parents make of it. If you don't do well, it isn't necessarily the school's fault. It really is up to the student to do the work. Everyone I know went to public school and on to college. We didn't feel unprepared. Maybe schools were better then. I hope these kids get a chance in life their parents are denying them.
