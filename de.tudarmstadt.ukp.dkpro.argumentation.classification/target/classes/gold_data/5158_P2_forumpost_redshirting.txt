I'm not really trying to justify my decision with how my DH felt about starting school at 4. I was just giving his point of view. Most adults I know who started school at age 4 did not like being younger than their peers. Granted here in the midwest, most kids start school at a solid 5 years old and many turn 6 in KG. There are parents here who send their 4 (clost to 5) year olds to school, but it is usually in order to not have to pay for daycare any longer. 
Our DS will not be very much older than most kids in his class. Any children who turn 5 after July 1st will not start school until next year, so DS will be one of the oldest in his class, but not because we "redshirted" him or "held him back". 
As I have said many times, other people's kids to not factor in my decision to wait to send my son to school. MY child was the deciding factor. Why does it bother parents so much that other parents decide to wait to send their child to school. That puzzles me.
