Individual prayer is not banned from schools, but school-sanctioned group prayer is, and for a damn good reason. 
Not permitting group prayer sessions in schools is not the same as kicking god out of schools. Not at ALL. And you are all doing a huge disrespect to people that have actually been put through pain and killed over their religious beliefs in other less-free nations, and in other places in the past. To play this debate off as some kind of religious persecution only weakens your message to anyone with a shred of common sense. 
There’s absolutely nothing stopping kids from bringing God into schools with them in their hearts and minds. But public schools are an open, secular institution. If you feel that your kid isn’t getting enough of God, you need to stop blaming schools and instead step up to the plate yourself.
