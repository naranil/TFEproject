I find it deeply offensive when parents imply that they send their kids to private schools because they care about them more. There's plenty of evidence to show that the best thing you can do for your kids is engage with them (ie. more time at home, less time at work) and make their home life an enriching one. This is not about real "choice". When middle-class parents go private, they are supporting a shift that will see public schools become a residual system for the poor. I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in. To me, learning to care about and contribute to society as a whole - not just your own personal interests - is the best value a child can inherit. 
How well a child does at school depends on the child itself not the school it goes to.Attitude to studies is all important.If a student's mind is occupied with sex, drugs and alcohol you can't expect good results. Set high moral standards for your child and encourage the proper attitude to study and life in general and it won't matter which school he/she attends.Education for life is not solely the job of teachers it starts at home in the child's earliest years.Parents should lead by example.
