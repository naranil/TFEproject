There is also online schooling.  My brother's granddaughter did very well the year she took it. No teachers to snoop through her purse and her lunch and subjects she needed, not what the public schools offer.  When she went back to public school the next year her grades plummeted and my brother went ballistic when her teacher removed some food from her lunch bag saying it was bad for her.  Her lunch that day consisted of a turkey sandwich, an orange, a small bottle of something like Propel water( I don't remember what he told me about that) and an oatmeal cookie.  The teacher removed the cookie and the water.  Since when does a teacher have the right to do this?
