What a joke this is. If I could afford a private school (and if i had a kid), I'd send them in a heartbeat. Why send them to a public school that has behavior problems, graffiti in the hallways, rotten old classrooms with NO TEXTBOOKS FOR KIDS TO TAKE HOME, classes of 40+ kids, and no toilet paper?
