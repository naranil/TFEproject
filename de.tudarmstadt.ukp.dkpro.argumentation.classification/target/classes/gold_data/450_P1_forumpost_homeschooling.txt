I'm going to start this by saying that I have no read every post in this thread. I don't have the time. But having been home schooled (or 'unschooled' as my parents like to say) I would like to add my experiences. 
My parents both attended public schools growing up, and both went on to higher education. My dad has a Masters degree and my mom has a Bachelors. Both of them hated school up until college. Well, my dad really hated it up until graduates school, but close enough. So when they had kids they decided not to send us to any kind of school unless we expressed interest ourselves. Our family has a rather unique living situation though, which made my parents equipped to teach us in a way that many parents lack. 
We live in an intentional community in which people come and go on a very regular basis. When I was born we lived in the city, and by the time we moved to the country when I was three I had lived with over 50 different people. And those were the ones who stayed more than a week. Things move a bit slower in the country, but we still have a lot of people moving through. I've sat down to dinner with people of many races, genders, ages, and beliefs. Every single person I have lived with has taught me something, whether it was intentional or not. 
My parents also love to travel, and since neither of them have a 9-5 job we took a lot of road trips when I was younger. We spent hours in museums, libraries, art galleries. I learned to read at 6 and have been an avid reader ever since. My grandmother is an artist and so we learned to draw, paint, and sculpt from her. Myself, my brother, and my sister, all tried public school at different points. My brother lasted through the entirety of 8th grade and half of 9th. I did two weeks of 8th, and my sister was only there 4 days, also in 8th grade. After that attempt at school I decided to go ahead and get my GED. I had took months of weekly meetings with a math tutor, my first traditional learning experience since my mom taught me how to read. I passed the test at 16 with a near perfect score in English, and high scores in every else except the math which was merely passable. My sister is now attending the local community classes at 15, and my brother (who also got his GED at 16) has an apprentice ship with an electrician. I work full time at a stable nearby teaching at risk children how to ride horses. 
Home schooling is definitely not for everyone. My parents had the resources to be able to educate us in a way that school would have been unable to do. If I ever have children I will definitely be home schooling if possible.
