I sent my children to Catholic school because I wanted them to get reenforcement about their Catholic upbringing plus I wanted them to have the freedom to celebrate the Catholic religious days including Christmas and Easter....Happy Holiday is not Christmas or Easter.  Christmas is the celebration of Jesis' birth and the public schools in Lakewood did not allow a nativity scene to be displayed or religious songs to be sung at the Christmas concert.  Easter is the celebration of Jesus' ressurection and the public schools in Lakewood did not allow a crucifix to be displayed.    I wanted my children to be in a loving and religious environment with religious FREEDOM!!
