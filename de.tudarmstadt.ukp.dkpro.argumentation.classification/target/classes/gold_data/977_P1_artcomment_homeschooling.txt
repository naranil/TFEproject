I absolutely agree that there is too much government interference with pretty much everything these days, however I believe they are damned if they do and damned if they don't, no-body seems to know where to draw the line & perhaps they don't dare take that responsibility. With home education it's easy to assume that all parents are good teachers because they have their kids best interests at heart, but perhaps there are some (no many I hope) whom through no fault or their own are just not qualified to deliver a balanced education, perhaps there are those who are going to have lazy days and just watch Jeremy Kyle instead and leave the education to a cd rom. Both my kids went through the schooling process and came out with very different results, I wish I had thought of home education for the one that struggled, he may be in a much better position now.
