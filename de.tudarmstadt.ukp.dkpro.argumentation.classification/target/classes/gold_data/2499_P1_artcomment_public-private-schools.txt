Sending your child to a private school is one of the best things you can do for them.  The teachers do not open up a text book and teach every child the same way.  Private teachers have more passion about teaching  because they are free to write their own curriculum for each child based on developmental assessments and achievements to where each child is learning at the level they need to be at and not just a class as a whole.  Children in the public school systems ARE left behind, bullied, and not challenged enough in their own learning capabilities. When your public school system ranks #50 in the nation you tell me, would you rather send your child to public school or honor them with attending a private school?
