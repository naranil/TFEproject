The writer is so Wrong, we could invest all the money in the world in to Public school and the fact is, you still won't be able to say a prayer before class, still won't be aloud to sing Christmas song that have the name CHRIST in it, & we still would not be aloud to put a cross up in the class room BECAUSE it's PUBLIC SCHOOL can't offend anyone!   My children go to private school for more then an education but to also be closer to god which they can't aren't aloud to do in Public school.
