Sad that someone would actually post this.  In many parts of this country it's the bad parents that don't care about their children education or support the teachers that  make public schools so bad and drive hard working people to work two jobs so they can afford to send their children to better schools. Where teachers can focus on teaching rather than riot control and less time to help struggling kids or kids that excel.   Best way to improve education is to attach tax dollars to students which drives competition to attract students and provide schools to meet different learning needs.  20/20 did a piece on Education in the US that says it all.  Some European schools do this very thing at elementary level and their students test years ahead of US schools.  We do fund college students with money to the student and they choose the best schools why not at lower levels?
