Public school is for everyone, private school is for people who want to be seperated from the whole. These parents believe they will give an advantage to their children by getting the best education possible. What they forget is that education is only one part of creating a whole human being. Many of the comments are political, some are biased, but one must consider what education means. When you send your child to school, it is to educate them on topics that as parents you may not know about or cannot communicate to them as well as a qualified teacher can. Those who misbehave in class have problems the teacher cannot help the child with, mainly because they are not qualified psychologist or other professional. Let those parents keep throwing money into private schools that obviously do not completely produce a mature adult. Only parents can do this. Public schools need help for one very basic reason, the majority of children go to public school. The young are the backbone of any country. The schism between rich and poor will increase. We all know how this story ends.
