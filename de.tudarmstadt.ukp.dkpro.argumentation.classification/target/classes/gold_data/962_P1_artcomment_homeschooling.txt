Home schooling of chidren is, in my opinion, a form of abuse.
Children need to learn general social skills and not be locked into the mindset of their parents. 
I would genuinely worry about any parent who wants to remove their child from social contact and totally control their childs learning. 
Most of what you learn in school, especially at a young age, is not from the teacher but from being around your classmates. 
To deny that irreplacable gift to your own child is frankly sick and a sign of narcissism.
