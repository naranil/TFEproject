The constructive focus to the problem is to get the Public School Boards, along with the PTA's and  the school communities actively participating in a crusade to improve each school.   Market forces at play, people would pay more for what they want/need.   Our kids education is the single most important investment in our lives.   Of course, we all would rather avoid the extra expense.   But, if we feel that our kids need better education than the one given in Public Schools we will pay for a private school. Elevate the performance of Public Education and you'll see less people inclined to pay for private schools...    You want more support for Public Schools ???   Like anything else...   First, you create the product and if the customers want it the demand for it rises...   Simple as that
