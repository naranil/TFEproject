I went to public schools in the 70s and 80's.  At that time our public schools were racially mixed.  While there were some problems we all learned that we have to live and work with one another.  You don't see schools like that nowadays. Schools today are more intergrated than ever.   I think it's very sad.  If more middle class people would send their kids to public schools the schools would greatly improve.  However, it's going to take a large enough group of people doing this in order make it work. Tossing one or two kids into an a low performing school isn't going to do anyone any good.  If all the arm chair liberals in the suburbs would get out and practice what they preach, the world could be a much better place.
