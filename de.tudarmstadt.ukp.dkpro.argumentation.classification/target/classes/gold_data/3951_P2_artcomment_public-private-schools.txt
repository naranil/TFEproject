What a weak argument.   I pay my taxes and my township has a school board and administration that is paid with those taxes (all overpaid with fat pensions I might add)-fixing the school system so I would want to educate my children there is their job, not mine.   It is bad enough that I have to pay the taxes and then send them somewhere else; being implicated as part of the problem is beyond insulting.
