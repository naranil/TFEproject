Yes, that's true, but the purpose is to give students time to collect thoughts, pray, do homework for the class at hand, etc. Sorry, I can't quote the source, but I read some statistics the other day that students who make time each day for some silence (not necessarily religiously related silence and/or prayer, just silence) do much better in school because people don't realize how much noise dominates our days and inhibits our thought. I don't think 2 minutes of silence could possibly hinder our absolutely terrible public education any further than it's current decrepit state. 
It's all good. Don't worry, I agree. Trust me, I know. First hand.
Learn what? The BS they half-arsedly try to teach us? I attended private school up until age 14, and I have yet to learn anything from our public ed. system. 
True, but the scenario at the top was obviously over-the-top wrong. I just wanted to present a much more common iteration.
