My daughter will be 5 in Sept. and she is going to Kindergarten. She is very excited to go and I don’t want her to be behind. She can write her on name and knows some of her Abc’s but not all of them. She is small for age, but so was I. I was probably one if the smallest kids in my class my entire life but my mom did not hold me back and I am glad. I had some issues when I was younger with a learning disability, but I learned to cope. I had a lot of friends and even skipped a year of high school.
