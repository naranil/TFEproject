That's partially true. If you don't actually register your child and have them show up to class, the school won't actually get the money that was allocated for your child. 
Kind of.
When I lived in MN, I taught at a Catholic school. Our students received a number of "services" from the district, despite not taking classes there, that were ultimately funded via state money that was channeled through the district. Among them: 
-- funding for textbooks, as long as the textbooks didn't include religion
-- special ed services for qualified students, including transportation to and from the public school that provided the services when needed (some services were provided by district employees who came to our school, others weren't) 
-- bussing to and from school, though parents might have paid for a portion of this, I'm not sure 
Our students didn't have to take any classes at the public schools, or be registered there, to receive those services, unless you could the special ed students who took the special ed classes there.
