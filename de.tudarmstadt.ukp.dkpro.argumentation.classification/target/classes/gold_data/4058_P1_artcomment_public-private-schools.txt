There's no way in he** I would send my kid to a public school in today's times.  The public school that I went to now has gangs that walk the hallways.  Just about every week cops are called to this school because of either a shooting/stabbing.  The neighboring county public schools are the same.  Your public schools in parts of this country have become a cess pool of degenerates and with parents that are about the same.  I would work two jobs if needed to send my kid to a private school (one that I had done a lot of background checking into first).  Not saying that private schools don't have problems either but none to the ratio that public schools have.
