Your statistics are flawed. Look at the various links on this page. In particular, http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmchilsch/memo/elehomed/me7402.htm. The evidence presented by Watson, a science teacher who is not himself home educating, reflects precisely our own experience over the 16 years we were home educating. See also my post above. I have 2 high achieving children in professional jobs earning way above the national average. More importantly, they are both self confident, caring, happy in themselves, interested and interesting people. 
Perhaps the (perceived) problems with your god daughter were the result of her being "schooled" and not "educated". The difference is what makes home education work.
