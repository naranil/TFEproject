Our daughter barely made the age cut-off for kindergarten (late summer birthday), but against our better judgement we started her anyway. A couple years later she continued to struggle behind her classmates. She is repeating 3rd grade this year and is having a much better time of it, not just academically, but also socially. The school was reluctant to retain her and told us this was rarely done, but we know this was the best decision we ever could have made. She will still only be 18 when she graduates from high school.
