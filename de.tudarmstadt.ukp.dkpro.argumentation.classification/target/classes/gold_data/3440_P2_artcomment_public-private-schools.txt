I'm not a parent, but I believe parents have every right  to give their children anything that will help them in life. Besides I went to private for 8 years of my life. When I made the transition to public school, I became aware of adult things, and illegal substances. Also, Parents have the money because they worked for it. No has no right to tell them how to spend it.
