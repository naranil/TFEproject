Hmmmmmmmmm, let me see if I understand this......If everyone had to drive a Dodge, then Dodge would be better.  If everyone had to use Sprint for phone service, then Sprint would be better.  If everyone ate dinner only at McDonalds then McDonalds would be better.  Just what I expected.  Let's embrace our lowest common denominator.  Striving for excellent is now out of vogue.  If you have any money, you are considered worthless and selfish.  When our country is purchased and we are enslaved by high achievers maybe the population will finally understand that the "progressives" had it all wrong.  Surely our new rulers will be kind and gentle people who care about our feelings.  Our local prep school operates on only 55% of the student cost as the public school down the street.  Bureaucracies are inefficient, especially when dealing in human capital.  God save us from these morons...please.
