Anyone remember Bill Gothard and his Institute in Basic Life Principles out of Indianapolis, and their "seminars" held all over the U.S. and outside of the U.S., and their push for homeschooling? I recall meeting people from this group in my younger years . . . I guess they are still going strong and every now and then you hear a politician in Alaska or somewhere that is pushing their agenda on the community.
