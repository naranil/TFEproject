At what expense to our children? First it will take to long to make the changes needed if you could get them changed at all. The first 10 years or more would focus on trying to fix the system that is very broken and having to build more schools. So these first children coming from the private schools are leaving a better education for what? I for one wouldn't sacrifice my daughters education in HOPE to have a better education for children in the future. That is not my job that is the job of the state. When they figure it out then ok maybe we could see it different but in the mean time we are doing whats best for our children and that is admirable.
