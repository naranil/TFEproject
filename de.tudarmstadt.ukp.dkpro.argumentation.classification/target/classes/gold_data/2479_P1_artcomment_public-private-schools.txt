I believe that envy is one of the carnal sins. Any parent, and I do mean any, that would do less for their children than they are able to are guilty of child abuse. If you have the ability to send your children to private school and choose not to, then it is clear that you love money more than your children. Parents who send their children to private schools do support public schools. Just who do you think pays for the schools? They pay most, if not all of the taxes that support the socialistic schools. Few children can rise above the poor education of a public school and that is why most of our leaders attended private schools and why they send their children to private schools also. A very few excel, but they are the type who would have exceled even without schooling, so they exceled in spite of public schools. What is wrong with this country is public schools and people that believe that someone owes them something. If you wish to improve public schools the only answer is to get government out of education and turn it back to local control. When I went to the schools about my children I was treated like an interloper and talked down to as if I was beneath them. The schools and government seem to think that my children belong to them.
