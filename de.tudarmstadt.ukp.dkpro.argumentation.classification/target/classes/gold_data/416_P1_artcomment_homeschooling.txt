author="Timaree"> My daughter has home schooled some of her kids in California. The curriculum if from the school district and they check in once a week for tests, new lessons and guidance. This gives a lot of the good from both sides. The bad part is, the homeschoolers have to complete more work than school educated kids and they don't get time off for all the holidays having to still turn all the work in on schedule. The kids still take all the state tests and are doing fine on them. But, this has allowed for personality, disability and scheduling differences which is good and still ensures they get a decent education.
