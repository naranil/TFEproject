In public school I learned everything I needed to graduate in about 10th grade. The last few years where a joke. Same english class over and over again, hey I can read a book and write a report on it. How many times do I have to do this? Go to college and the first thing I do is take english, read a book and write a report. Why waste time and money, so much is useless at school these days.
