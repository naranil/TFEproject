I send my child to a private school, not only because they can pray and use the word "God", but because a private school can get rid of a bad teacher at any time. Public school teachers have a union that allows them to continue to work because they have "X" number of years. Public school teachers should continue to get better, continue their education and be held accountable for the product that they put out. I'm certainly not a "wealthy" person but choose to send my child to a private school because all the parents at the school care about their child and doesn't depend on the school and the teachers to raise the child. Bad parents send their child to a public school and think they don't need to be involved with the education of their own child. Not all parents of public school kids are bad, but none at a private school think that it is the schools responsibility to education the child.
