I have noticed that educators seem to take my decision to homeschool very personally. It's strange. 
I noticed this too. As a former teacher I really don't understand how a child being homeschooled has any effect on the teacher in the classroom. Homeschooling is not putting their job in jeopardy nor is it a reflection of the job that they are specifically doing.
