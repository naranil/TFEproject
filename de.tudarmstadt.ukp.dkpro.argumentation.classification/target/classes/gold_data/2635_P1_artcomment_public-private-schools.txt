Public schools vary greatly across the nation; some are as good as "elite" private schools, and others can be deplorable. Neighbors, peer groups, and the educators they attract are critical.   Lost in this discussion seems to be the fundamental reason our nation has public schools: to develop citizens who embody knowledge, skills, and character along with a continued thirst for learning. We all support public schools through tax dollars, and we all have a stake in the outcome of any child's education.   Our schools are here not just to serve the public but to create a "public." A private school also might accomplish this, but has no civic obligation to do so, and many don't. If your public schools fall short, then we all need to work for change. When a nation does this well, we have reconciled and found the essential balance between "individualism" and "republicanism."
