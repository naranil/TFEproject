Interesting. I commend your commitment and I wish you all the best for your sons. I suspect you will probably do a better job of educating them than most schools would. 
I can't help wondering, though, what the fallout is likely to be in terms of their ability to socialise with other kids. Whatever home schooling does for you intellectually, I can't think it can have that great an influence on their ability to fit in with other kids. 
Prepared to be proved wrong though....
