Otherwise it doesn't make sense. Regardless of when they start school they will be edcuated for 13 years of their lives. Why do parents feel the need to push other parents to start their children younger? 
Redshirting isn't just about your individual kid. Studies show the practice (when common) has socioeconomic repurcissions down the line and can increase the HS drop out rate for lower-income kids who were not themselves redshirted as well as other disadvangates economically for society. I posted a study a few pages back. There are lots of similar findings.
