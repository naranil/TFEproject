My wife and I live in a very expensive suburb. We pay very high taxes, most of which are allocated to an adequate school system that is monetarily driven by a broken system designed to teach children the answers to the questions  not how they derive at them.  As such there is pressure on the schools  to meet the GPA standards that there states put on the schools that they have forgotten why the children are there in the first place. Every other week we hear stories about another child that has died from an overdose of heroin and how it has become an epidemic in the school systems. I am sorry but we are forced through our property taxes to support a system that we do not believe works and shows no sign of improving. We also incur the additional cost associate with sending our child to a school we feel confident will give her what she need to be successful in life. So I say Allison Benedikt, treat the cause not the system. I continue to monetarily support a broken system that I can not even take advantage the so called benefits of because it does not give my child the adequate tools she will need to be successful in life. I in good conscience could not ask anyone else to through good money after bad as you suggest that we all do.
