Firmly believe that Josh's parents can inculcate him with belief in the Great Pumpkin, that the colour purple keeps away cooties or anything else they want. However, if they decided pumpkin pulp was the food of life and denied him access to fruit, veg, meat , milk and other dietary necessities the state would rightly step in for denying him the necessities of life. Same with schooling. Period, No argument.
