I can attest to the idea that things even out by 3rd grade. My daughter was 4 when she started kindergarten, turned 5 in late Sept. She thrived socially, but was definitely "middle of the pack" academically till the end of 2nd grade, when something kicked in, and she started caring more about doing well in school. Now she's in 7th grade, and still at the top of her class. I worry some about her going off to college at age 17, but the idea of a gap year at 17 to engage in a rewarding volunteer experience sounds better to me than an extra year spent in preschool would have been.
