Sent both my kids to private schools, after trying public schools for a short time.  Public schools should try to copy the private schools, then maybe they would improve.  It's not the money because parochial schools have far fewer funds than public schools and still do a better job. Parents who fork over a bundle for tuition in private schools are still paying school taxes to the public schools, and your calling them bad.  Get real.
