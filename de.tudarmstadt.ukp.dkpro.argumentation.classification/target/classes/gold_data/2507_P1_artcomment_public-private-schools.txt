Does Allison Benedikt have children?  All my children went to public school.  But I had to move to a location in a good school district.  The location where I did live lacked good teachers and good curriculum.  Sure my children would have excelled in that school but they would never been challenged.  In the Pendleton Heights school system my children excelled and were challenged.  Parents should always have the welfare of their at the top of the list.  If that includes enrolling them in a private school so be it. That doesn't make them bad people.
