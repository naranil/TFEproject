Am I a bad person to fly First Class because Economy stinks?? Come on!  If I had the money, I'd send my kids to private school, too. This is a free country with freedom of choice and that includes the choice where I send my kids to school! Even within the public school system parents try to place their kids in the best school districts and/or schools, going as far as making sure they move to the "right" zip code!
