Prayer is religious in nature as it is a religious practice (sorry but agnostics and atheists don't prey to a "God" or "Gods") and religion has no place in the public school system unless your school is faith based and publicly funded. My children all went to Catholic school their entire lives as it's what my husband (who is Catholic) wanted, they did have prayer after morning announcements and only took 2 minutes (a total of 5 minutes combined). I have no issue with that as it was a religious based educational institution, but if they were in a non-religious, publicly funded school I would have a problem with that as the public school system was designed to keep church out of the state and provide a learning environment for everyone whether they believe in some all knowing sky deity or not. Let's keep the two publicly funded systems separate, allow prayer in Catholic, Evangelical, Islamic, Jewish etc based public funded schools. But non-religious based public funded schools religion simply does not belong as it's supposed to be available to everyone no matter your faith, creed, or color.
