IF this were true, then why don't the parents whose kids ARE in the public school system work to improve it?  You're blaming people who choose to walk away in disgust (often while paying tax money ANYWAY to subsidize failure) yet ignoring the obvious.  If the problems could be solved by more involved parents (and a majority of them probably can be), then put the onus on the remaining parents to rise up and get more involved.  If the failing public schools were to suddenly get better because the parents whose kids are 'stuck' there demanded better, likely the parents of private school kids would put their kids back in public schools.   Bottom line:  Yet again left wingers hate competition and choice and want to force EVERYONE into their failed system (see also:  Obamacare).
