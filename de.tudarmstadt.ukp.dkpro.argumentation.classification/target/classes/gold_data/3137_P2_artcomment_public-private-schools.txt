Somebody sounds a little bitter their kids school sucks, don't put it on the rest of us who do whatever we have to to put out kids education first. It all boils down to priorities, I don't go have my nails done, or out to eat weekly, or waist money on entertainment, if you have a problem with the public school system YOU do something about it.
