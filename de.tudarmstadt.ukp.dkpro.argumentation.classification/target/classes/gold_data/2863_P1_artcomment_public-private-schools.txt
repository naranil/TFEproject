If you can afford to send your kids to private schools do. Most public schools especially those that are intercity are not good. My son went to Columbus Public Schools, in Columbus, Ohio and they treated him and myself badly. I was constantly in the school and very involved in his education. It made no difference. They didn't want my help or my commitment to the school.  I moved to the suburbs and the education in our suburban public schools are good the teachers were better and they appreciated my involvement. I wish I had moved sooner, but if I could have afforded private school my son would have gone. So in Columbus, Ohio if you can't afford private school move to the suburbs. I also agree God should have never came out of the schools.
