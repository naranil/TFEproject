Private schools succeed where public schools fail largely because in a public school the teacher's hands are tied by politically correct nonsense.  They cannot correct errors, cannot encourage high achievers for fear of upsetting the regular students, assign homework, or expect respect from the students. The inmates are running the asylum in many public schools.
