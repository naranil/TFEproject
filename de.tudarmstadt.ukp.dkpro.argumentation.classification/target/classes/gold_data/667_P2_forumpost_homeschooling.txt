Just to be clear, there are a couple million funding allocations, so it's petty bewildering. But generally speaking, schools provide facilities, staff, and compliance as a function of their enrollment. So when kids are not enrolled, per the local or state guidelines, the school is not being compensated for their presence. 
Only if that's how the state has set it up.
Again, take it up with the state, rather than with the homeschoolers themselves.
