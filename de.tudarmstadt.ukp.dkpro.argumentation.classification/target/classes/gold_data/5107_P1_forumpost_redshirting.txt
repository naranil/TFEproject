Children should be placed in the appropriate grade based on the district guidelines unless there is a documented need to do otherwise. Parents should be able to keep their kids home an extra year if they believe their child isn't ready for the classroom environment, but when they enroll they should be put into the 1st grade (again unless there is a documented delay).
