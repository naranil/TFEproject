If I had the money I would send my children to a private school.  The public schools should go back to teaching   children. they are now into food. and everything else but teaching.  try to get after school help in our local school and they tell you no.  some schools send you home if you have any team shirt other than the state or local teams shirt. lease out the food program and save us money. so many things are wrong with local school. go back to teaching.
