I understand yet its a choice which as parents we have the freedom to choose where we want our children to be educated, It doesn;t make them bad and it doesn't make a parent who's child attends public school any less, as long as the children are learning and growing into productive people should it matter? Be grateful for what you have, Some of our greatest gifts we have is our abilities to look, learn listen attentatively and show respect,  to read write and comprehend it, to know show and see these realities are precious to the wise, so teach the children everyday so that they can build a better future for generations to come. Peace!
