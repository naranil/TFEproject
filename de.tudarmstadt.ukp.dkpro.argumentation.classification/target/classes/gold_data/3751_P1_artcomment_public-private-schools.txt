The argument that sending your kids to private school is bad parenting is nonsensical. I bothers me that Allison Benedikt (I suppose and intelligent woman) makes the statement and it further bothers me that this article says her argument is"compelling." She argues that if parents who opt to send their kids to private schools, sent their children to public, the schools the schools would change. That's a foolish idea. How many parents are there have their kids in public schools that wish the school system was different. The answer is probably most. The problem with her argument is that she blames fearful and frustrated parents that remove their children from a ridged and ineffective school system for the problem.Problems in the schools systems are not the parents fault, it's the systems fault. What are parents to do when Unions refuse to correct or fire ineffective school teachers because they have tenure and are protected by unions. What are parents to do when school boards respond for the calls for reform with the formation of yet another useless committee that will investigate the matter and make recommendations that are never put into effect. If millions of frustrated parents cannot change the system, what makes you think a few others can. Your argument is stupid. and for the author of this article to call it compelling is sad.
