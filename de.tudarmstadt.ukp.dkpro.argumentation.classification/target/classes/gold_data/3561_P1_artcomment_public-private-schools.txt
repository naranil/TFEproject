Maybe if Ms. Benedikt  look at the way Public Schools teach she would understand why we send are kids to Private Schools. Our Public Schools are broken and have been for some time. To much government, administration and other factors have made our Public Schools nothing more than baby setter. It looks to me that Ms. Benedikt and others in the public school system are  part of the problem. Not the solution. Its time to get back to the three "R". And get government out of the are school system. Maybe then we wouldn't have to put our kids in a private school.
