I have been a fan of the public school system for a long time, but I finally left the public school system this year (after a 9 year commitment) becauseI realized no matter how involved I became, how much money I raised, how many PTA boards I ran, how many enrichment programs I sponsored, how many school board meetings I attended, I could not fix the system.  The problem goes beyond the quality of the children attending or parental involvement.  In California, there are 47-50 kids in a middle school classroom (38 in elementary school), an unyeilding beaurocracy, too much focus on state test results, a lack of critical thinking skills, and huge budget cuts resulting in the elimination of arts, sports, enrichment programs, etc.   Your writer fails to identify "how" exactly the return of the private school parent and child to the public school system is going to solve these problems. Enlighten me!
