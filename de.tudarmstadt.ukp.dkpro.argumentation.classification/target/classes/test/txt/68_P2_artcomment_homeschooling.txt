What a great story about the power of self-motivated education! Clearly the lesson to be drawn is that the reporting exemption for religious reasons is silly. There should be no reporting requirements for homeschoolers whatsoever, religious or not! Similarly, young Josh's experiences show that even the removal of compulsory schooling is not enough. Liberation from parents should be more easily achievable. The lessons of liberty are quite clearly overwhelming. Thanks WP! I'm not used to such obvious evidence in favor of freedom coming from your organization.
