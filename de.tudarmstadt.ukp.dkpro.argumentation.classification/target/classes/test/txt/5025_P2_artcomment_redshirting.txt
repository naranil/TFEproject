As a teacher and parent I feel it isn’t black and white, but completely depends on the child. I don’t necessarily agree with holding a child back for an athletic advantage. I do see holding them back if they are not socially and academically ready. I can usually pick out the September- November babies within the first week of school and I teach fourth grade. If you decide to put your children through and they are socially immature they will catch up eventually. Once you enter the workforce you are surrounded by people of all ages and it no longer matters. I think either way is ok, whatever works best for the parents and children.
