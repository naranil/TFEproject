That is an alarming thought! I didn't turn 18 until I was away at college! Molly will <i>be</i> 5 when she starts kindergarten, and turn 6 in mid-November. Which will make her 18, getting to turn 19 when she starts college (providing she stays true to the current age requirements). 
On the up side for her - she won't be one of the last of her friends to get her driver's license, or be able to legally drink. Not exactly a mother's fondest wish for her kid, but I do remember being frustrated with those little issue myself. A lot of my friends could go out to bars halfway through junior year, and I had to wait until the fall of my senior year. That did suck!
