*Typically you're a great debater, but you've been fairly hostile and borderline rude in this thread.* 
I get borderline hostile when someone mischaracterizes my statements repeatedly.
*...because you only want to utilize one educational option*
Where did I say that?
*you feel that everyone should have to only choose one.*
Also wrong.
*you clearly don't understand the meaning of equal access.*
You clearly don't understand the meaning of double standards. *The only unfair thing that I'm seeing is the idea that a child is not worthy of a fully comprehensive education because some people would make a different educational choice for their children.* 
It's interesting you mention that, given that one of my primary concerns is parents who homeschool specifically to deprive their children of a comprehensive education.
