If we allow Christian students to pray, you must allow Wiccan students to pray, Jewish, Islamic, Muslim. 
You have to allow ALL of them to pray and wear their religious symbols. You have to agree to not frown upon them not participating in group prayer. 
If schools would agree to this, then why not?
