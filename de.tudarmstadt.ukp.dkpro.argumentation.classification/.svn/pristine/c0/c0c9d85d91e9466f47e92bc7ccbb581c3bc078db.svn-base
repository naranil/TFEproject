This reasoning is so stupid! So the parents who send their kids to public schools are sitting on their asses, allowing for poor education....but, if the parents who send their kids to private school send them instead to public schools, they will fix the public school system because they care more about their child's education than the rest of us? Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what I got out of all of this. Public or private, we as parents all want what's best for our kids!
