This is going to remain a problem while bigots in Ontario defend one particular religion having 100% publicly-funded schools, ignoring the lack of equality. 
If you want to ban this kind of thing, you also have to ban publicly-funded Catholic schools in Ontario, the same way they have been banned in recent years in QuÃ©bec and Newfoundland & Labrador. 
Christian schools were previously protected in those other provinces, and there was no problem in amending the Constitution to remove that protection. 
It's time to end the bigotry!
