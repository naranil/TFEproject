Our local school district is good up through elementary. After that it is unsafe and the teachers are constantly telling me they are afraid of the students. Both of my children went to public school until middle school then went to private. Most school districts have pay scales so the argument about the best teachers make more money is hogwash. Show me the stats for public school college acceptance and good private school education. The people who can afford private schools and keep their child in public are not putting money into the system. They are just selfish. My opinion only.
