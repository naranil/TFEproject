Wow anyone who does not believe prayer should be in school has not studied history. The fact is that as long as we were a praying nation in school and in government we were truly a blessed nation. Since that was removed almost 50 years ago we have been spiralling out of control. Just because you don’t believe something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Try reading the BIBLE and see what it says. Every knee will bow and toung confess that JESUS is LORD. You don’t have to believe it but it’s true.
