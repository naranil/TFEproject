What a stupid argument!  You are a bad person if you don't do whatever it takes to get YOUR child the best education and start in life possible, and if that means sending your child to private school, that's what you do.   Not all people who forego public schools are wealthy, some of had to sacrifice to do it, but it was definitely worth every penny.   Private and parochial schools are more likely to adhere to the same value system as the families whose kids attend them, while public schools tend to reflect the values of whatever politician is in charge of them at the moment. The writer is free to send her kids wherever she wants and so is everyone else.  IMO the only 'bad person' here is the person writing the article.
