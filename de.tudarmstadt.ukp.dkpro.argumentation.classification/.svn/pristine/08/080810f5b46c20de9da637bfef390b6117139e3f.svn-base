Thanks for the statical analysis (henceforward to be known as the JennM's god daughter report). 
Good luck with educating your daughter at home, Annabel. My only experience was meeting two children in France who were educated by their French/British parents. I was very impressed but obviously, you'd need to look at a lot more examples. 
I think some level of supervision is essential, but it might help if those responsible had a certain degree of sympathy for parents like you.
