I would shell out the money for private school before I homeschool. I simply don't have the desire or patience to be THAT present. Maybe that makes me awful but I cannot and will not be everything to them 24/7. Imo it's not healthy for anyone. 
I am homeschooling and I am not under any illusion that I am "everything" for my kids 24/7. They have lots of great adults in their lives.
