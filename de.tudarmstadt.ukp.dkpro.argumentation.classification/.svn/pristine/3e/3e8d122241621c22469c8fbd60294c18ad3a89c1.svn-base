My Parents could barley afford to send my sister and I to private school.  Every year we would by used uniforms and used books whenever possible.  We took sack lunches and cut cost where ever possible. When we moved to an areas with better schools, we would go to public schools or magnet schools. We scrapped by then and now my sister and I have been pretty successful in life.  Both my sister and I plan to send our children to private school as well.  Why?  Because we got a better education than was available in most public schools.  When we both got to college we were ahead of the game with AP credits and CLEP tests. My parents would have always send us to Public schools if they were good schools.  Schools are not always bad because of funding etc.  Sometimes they are un areas that are mismanaged or just have bad teachers.  I can not tell you how many times I have come across teachers with over inflated egos.  They think they are a parent and saving the world of their students, when really they are incapable of passing on any amount of knowledge. Good schools draw good students regardless of a private or public classification.
