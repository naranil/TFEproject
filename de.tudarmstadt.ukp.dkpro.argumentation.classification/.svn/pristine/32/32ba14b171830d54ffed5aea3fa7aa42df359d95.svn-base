Some of the public schools around my hometown weren't just bad, they were dangerous. Fights and gangs (yes gangs in middle schools!) made it easy for parents to choose to send their kid to private schools even when it meant living on a strict budget just to pay tuition. I understand her argument, and yes the schools in my hometown continued to decline, but it was because parents who had the money or the strength to speak up about education sent their kids elsewhere out of fear. Her point is noble and just, but when it comes to looking at your own son or daughter, and a public school full of drugs and gangs, you're not going to risk your own child's life just to make a political point.
