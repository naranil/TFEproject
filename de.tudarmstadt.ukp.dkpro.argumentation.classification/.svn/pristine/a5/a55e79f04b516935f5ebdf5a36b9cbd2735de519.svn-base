I’m a 14-year-old student doing a research paper on prayer in schools. Alothough from most of the comments from the other users are mostly negetive, prayer in school isn’t needed. Just because America doesn’t have an “official religion” doesn’t mean it’s going to “go down in ruins.” Nobody is as crazy as they were before the abolishment of prayer in schools.
