I agree that this article is a crock! My wife and I are both school teachers. I worked in the public system, and she worked in the Catholic school system in our area. We are also far from rich. So why did we make all of the necessary sacrifices and send our four children through the private sector? One major reason - God is not allowed in the public schools, but He is more than welcomed in the private! So, I guess we are bad parents because we put our faith in God first and foremost. Isn't this an interesting country we live in when we have to justify practicing our religious freedoms!
