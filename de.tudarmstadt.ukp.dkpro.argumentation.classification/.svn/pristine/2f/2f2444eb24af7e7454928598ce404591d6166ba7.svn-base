Competition is what makes anything better (or eliminates it). We have very good public universities and collages because they have always had to compete with private schools (like Harvard started by the pilgrims).  So sending your kids to private schools will do more than anything else you can do to improve the public schools. I am a veterinarian if my clients started to leave my practice in droves, I can think of nothing else that would have as dramatic affect on how I run my practice.
