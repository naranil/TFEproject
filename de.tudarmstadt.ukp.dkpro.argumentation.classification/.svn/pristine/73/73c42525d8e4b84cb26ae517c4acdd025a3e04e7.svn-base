So if this is really the case ... if when to start school is for the best intereset of the child, then why can't people start their kids EARLY?! Why do so many schools make it near impossible to skip a year? But if you want to hold your kid back you just do it.? 
Because that is a case of funding and is out of the hands of the parent. States only provide funding for children who meet the age minimum. There are also many states and/or school districts that allow children to test in early. 
Perhaps it is regional, but why is it so many think that kindergarten is the only academically acceptable alternative to preK? Don't parents research what is available to them? We have many, many 'preschool' programs around here that cater to children who are academically ready to start K but don't meet the age requirements.
