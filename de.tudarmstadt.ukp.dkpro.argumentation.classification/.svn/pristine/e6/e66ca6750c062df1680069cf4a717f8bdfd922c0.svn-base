If you want your child to receive the best education they can get, send them to a private/parochial school. If you want them to have more diverse co- and extracurriculars, and go to a school where you don't have to pray for 10 minutes each day, or have to attend mass on occasion, send them to a LARGER public school. There is such a thing called "Advanced Placement", offered in both types of schools for the more gifted students.
