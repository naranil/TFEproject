The problem is that Democrat/socialists run most public schools and continue that in higher education which is also failing our children. There is no hope there but why should we wait until something is done. By that time my kids will be retired! We keep hearing that public school is where your kids get their social skills to go into the real world. You are sure as hell right about that today; how to roll a joint, how to talk on the phone; how to take it in the a$$! Great skills all.
