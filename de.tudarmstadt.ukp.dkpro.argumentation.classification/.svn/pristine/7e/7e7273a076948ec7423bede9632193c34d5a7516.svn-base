Public schools DO receive support from wealthy parents who send their children to private schools - TAX DOLLARS. If the administration, teachers, and parents who ARE in the schools cannot use those dollars, and their desire to improve their own surroundings, to make public eduction better, then far be it from me to sacrifice my child thinking it will change anything either.
