Depriving your child of a basic education is a form of child abuse. It can ruin your child's whole life. 
Home schooling should be illegal unless the parent can demonstrate that they are providing the same level of education as a public school. There should be a core national curriculum and testing to ensure children are achieving at least a basic level of education. 
In an increasingly complex, global technological society, all people need to have a basic understanding of science, technology and local and global culture, just to be able to function and make informed decisions. 
I don't see any need for home schooling any child unless the child has special needs or learning difficulties. If public schools are under-performing, then the public education system needs to be improved. Public education in the US seems to be a self-perpetuating disaster, with ignorant, uneducated, unqualified people on school boards deciding what children should learn.
