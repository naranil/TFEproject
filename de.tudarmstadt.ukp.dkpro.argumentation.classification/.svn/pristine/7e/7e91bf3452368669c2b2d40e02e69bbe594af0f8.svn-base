The public schools are a bad place to send a kid for a good education anymore. I remember when they started teaching in Spanish in the early 1990s in Illinois. My kids didn't speak Spanish, so I pulled them out, and they went to private schools after that. It's pretty bad when we have to raise kids that don't belong here. Also, the private schools don't teach all of this anti American social justice crap. Private schools don't promote all of this gay stuff that they call alternative lifestyles. Just look at the law that California governor Brown signed a couple of weeks ago. It says that transvestites can use either bathroom facilities, and that they can play on either team in sports, male or female. Just do what's best for your kids.
