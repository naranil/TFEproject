First off, we DO support the public school system. We still pay the full amount of taxes to the school, and I would bet I pay more than about 50% of kids that go there. The school charges me more just because my house is 300 square foot bigger than my neighbors. So what do I receive that's worth 300 more? You are looking at a result after 100 years and then asking the question in reverse. I would say, what can the public school system do to lure the kids away from private schools?  First, thing would be to drop the Common Core circ., Second, stop using our tax money to feed breakfast to kids and start buying teaching supplies, use money for teaching not feeding, we already pay tax money for food stamps and then pay again to feed them at school. Then when the other kids in school who's parents don't even think it is necessary to work for a living, fail tests, they lower the standards so the school will still get the same amount of money from the state for having good grades. So that means, the harder working students learning will not be up to what they are able to learn.     Third, bring back a religious section of school and let kids that want to learn in a religious environment  be able to do so, but don't mix them with students that think religion is a waste of time.    Bottom line, this writer want to take the good performing schools and make them like the poor performing schools, when it should be the other way around.       And by the way, was this letter written to Obamma, because he won't send his kids to a public school
