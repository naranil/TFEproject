who gives a crap if we can or can’t pray in schools, im a student in high school and i pray whenever i want even thoe we aren’t supposed to… I don’t care they can’t stop me and like they would say anything they can’t put me in jail for it anyway there is a freedom of speech and i will exercise it to talk with god just because its talking with god doesn’t mean it isn’t talking.
