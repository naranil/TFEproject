Our kids went to a private Christian School K-12, while they missed some of the opportunities the kids at the larger public school had, as in learning Chinese and a few AP classes they both got good educations. The one thing that stayed with me through the years is when our Headmaster told us that in a smaller school you at least "knew who the bad guys are", that is so true. By being involved in the school board, and on the PTA and just being there, I pretty much knew who I did and did not want my kids hanging out with, not to mention who I did and did not want my kids at the parents home, if a Mom comes to a PTA meeting sloppy drunk, my child will not be spending the night at her house. 
Testing is a mixed bag, while I think so many teach to the test and skip over critical thinking skills, the test do prepare for the ACT/SATs and that is still very important. Universities still do depend on these numbers for not only acceptance but for scholarships. A good ACT/SAT score can send a kid in our area through for 4 years, full ride. So just knowing "how" to test, is important also. Our kids have always had really good test scores, I think it was because they both had good reading comprehension, I know a couple of their friends that I would consider "smarter" than them, but did not test as well because (IMO) they were not excellent readers and it took them longer to pick up what the test were asking.
