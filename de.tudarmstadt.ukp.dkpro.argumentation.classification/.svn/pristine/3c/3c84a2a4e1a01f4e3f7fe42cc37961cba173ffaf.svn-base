I don't know about the rest of Virginia, but in Northern Virginia we have excellent public schools. The public schools are not churches and that seems to be the problem for some. There are many parents who attend my church who send their children to public schools to attain essential knowledge that they will need to find a job or go on to college. They also ensure that their children are trained in the Christian faith. It truly is not fair to deny children an education that they need to make their way in the world. Protecting them from heathen children is not a viable strategy. Once they start working, or going to college, they are going to be subjected to the reality of the secular world we live in, and it is better to prepare them for dealing with that fact before they are 18 years old.
