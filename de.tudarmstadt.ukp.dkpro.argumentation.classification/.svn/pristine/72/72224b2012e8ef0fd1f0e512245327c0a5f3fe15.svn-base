I do support public schools with my taxes. I then send my children to a private school to instill moral behavior and God in their lives. This nation was founded "under God" (the pledge of allegiance). Look at all the references to God in our nations capital. The inscriptions on the Lincoln Memorial states "this nation under God shall have a new freedom", At the very top of the Washington monument are the words "praise be to God", The inscription on  the Jefferson Memorial "God who gives us life gives us liberty". When the President gives his State of the Union address, above his head are the words "In God We Trust". These are just a few examples. Why is it then when in our public schools we can't mention or refer to God in any manner?
