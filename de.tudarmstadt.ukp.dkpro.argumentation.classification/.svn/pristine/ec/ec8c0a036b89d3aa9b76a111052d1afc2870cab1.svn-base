It is absolutely correct.   The ugly truth about private schools is that these institutions can select who attends through entrance exams and other admissions criteria.  They can also enforce consequences for attendance and discipline policies.  Public schools have neither option.  So, no special education, no behavior problems, and no unbalanced portion of low socio-economic students coming from families with suspect value of education.   More to the point, US public schools are the best in the world.  They are required to teach EVERYONE regardless of ability, income, behavior, etc...  Other countries have education systems built upon the tract theory where if a student fails a test at a certain grade level, that student moves into an alternative education tract that will prepare them for "career" training at their "ability level."  If students fail the high-stakes test in America, schools are forced to pass them on to the next grade, again, because public schools are rarely allowed to enforce retention policies to prevent students from being placed in classes beyond their demonstrable ability.  This ultimately results in other countries getting to the point where only best are tested and compared internationally, whereas American public schools test EVERY student at EVERY level.   With private schools stealing students away from public schools, the problem is exacerbated further.  Instead of keeping these bright and well-behaved students in the public schools as models to other students, private schools take only the best and claim that their system is better since their student body is so much more elite.  The simple fact is that these students will do well in any education venue.  More over, they will probably succeed in their work life no matter the school they attended. In light of that fact, there are only two reasons why students are enrolled in private schools: 1) It is a matter of prestige in order to instill an image of elitism, or 2) people have been intentionally misled into believing that private schools are "better" than their public counterparts.
