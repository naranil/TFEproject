Hi, Thank you for the replies.
As it goes, we (and by we, I mean me and the pre-school) are already in the process of getting a statement, I know the proceedures and how long it takes and the pre-school do also feel he needs that 1-1 as his concentration is not, not good. So for anything which requires him staying on track, he has to have someone constantly next to him. He's not been there for very long, and we've started I.E.P and I'm told DS is on Action. I know there is action plus to go through first and then the application for a statement... Which is why I'm thinking so early... 
Do you know if there is any other way that I can get a statement? Other than through pre-school as since his first I.E.P (Which targets he has met now) nothing else seems to have happened? 
Just terrified of the whole thing really!
