Eh. It's arguable. If someone drops a hundred dollar bill, should you keep it?
A hundred dollar bill is not a public service.
A better analogy would be something like a city fire department. Suppose I live in a neighborhood which has been recently annexed by a city. I am now included in that city's coverage area for fire department services. However, there are still some issues between the city and the state regarding the funding of the department. (Much of the department's funding is via local property taxes, but there is supplementation from the state.) Should I refrain from calling the fire department when I need their services, if I am aware that the funding issues are not yet resolved? Or should I call them to come and put out a fire in my home when I need it? 
Obviously, I should use the service that is provided. The solution is not for me to forego the service; the solution is for those who are involved with the funding process to fix the issues that are occurring.
