Private schools provide an option for respecting religion and expressing it publicly.  Values can be promoted, in accordance with the client population's choice.  We are so integrated in our neighborhoods and businesses that there is no chance that divisiveness might be exacerbated by private schools, especially in the contemporary religious environment.    Ms Wong is really the bad person here, because she wishes to impose a secularist establishment which cannot bring itself to keeping boys in the boys' lavatories or allowing even elective religiously supported ethical education to be presented to students.  That secularism was the worst feature of Soviet Communism and we know what it led to.
