Anyone who as the audacity to criticize someone on where they choose  to spend their hard earned money, ESPECIALLY when it comes to their child, should really think about educating themselves on not passsing judgement. How dare you call someone a "bad person" based on making a personal choice. I have 2 nieces. One who attends Private School and the other who attends Public. It has nothing to do with my sister being a "bad person" that one has decided she prefers to wear a uniform and attend much smaller classes while the other has chosen a more expansive environment. She is equally dedicated to both schools and volunteering her time and energy when she can for the betterment of both of her children. Shame on this article. It is ridiculous.
