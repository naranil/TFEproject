I have four kids, a girl 15, a boy 12, a boy 11, and a girl 10. I held the boys back but not the girls. For my 12 year old, I held him back because he was so tiny, he is either going to be very short or he has late onset puberty where he will grow very late. If he was in his own grade he would be the shortest in the class by A Lot. Now he is in the lower middle. He doesn’t play sports, he is more of an artist/musician so I didn’t do it for any competitive advantage. That being said, I shouldn’t have held him back because he is more EMOTIONALLY mature than his peers. I didn’t want him to be bullied or picked on for his short stature, but now because he is more mature than his peers, he doesn’t have as many friends in his grade. His friends are actually a few years older than him. He is also very intelligent and he is bored in school, now this may not have mattered if he was in a higher grade, but I think it does. We will see how it pans out. My other son, who has high functioning autism, I held back and it was the best decision I ever made. He fits in better, his emotional maturity is more on point and he is happy with his peer group. 
The girls mature faster, are more wired for the way the school system works and is set up and thrive at grade level. My oldest actually will start college next year spending 1/2 day at high school, 1/2 day at college. 
I guess the moral of the story. Know your kids, make informed, thoughtful decisions. Don’t judge others choices, we are all doing the best we can.
