...And another thing...   Let's look at the 'flavor of the day' argument, raising the minimum wage at McDonalds. I never eat at Mc. D's so I will use B.K.--(and I only eat there a few times a year-I'm in my 50's). But anyway, if a Whopper costs $3.00...and I don't remember if that's high or not...but the point is, if B.K. has to raise what they're paying the 'kids' working the broiler  from $7.50 to $15.00 bucks...the price of the Whopper will now have to be doubled to $6.00 (as well as many other menu items) to cover paying the workers twice as much. Point is , simple economics dictates certain things in a free market. With school systems, it's taxes. I pay an exorbidant amount of school tax where I live and DON'T have any kids. Yet I'm paying for everybody elses children to get their "free" education. Those who have kids and can afford it, will pay AGAIN to send their students to a private school to get the kind of education they believe they deserve but, probably WON'T get at a 'government school' . In fact, people with money to spare having to spend TWICE as much for education (their kids at a private school...and everyone elses at the public school) is just as big a waste of money as paying the local 19 year old fry-cook $20. bucks an hour. I would rather have him get his usual $8. dollars/hr. and only have to pay $2. bucks for  the frys. Then I can use the other $2. bucks to buy something else...or apply it to my overly high school taxes...or, apply it to the private school bill that will be coming soon. Or, better yet...how about I get a voucher for $3,000. instead of a tax bill and use that money to off-set the private school bill? I'll bet then I could even find an extra $2. bucks in my wallet to get an order of frys on the way home from my long work day !   You see it's ALL RELATED !!
