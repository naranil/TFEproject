I make many sacrifices to send my kids to a Catholic school because I want God to be involved in their learning.  Besides that, if all the private schools closed and all children were required to go to public schools, wouldn't they get overrun with more kids than they could handle while bringing in the same amount of money?  I believe I pay the same taxes for the public school system even though I do not use it.
