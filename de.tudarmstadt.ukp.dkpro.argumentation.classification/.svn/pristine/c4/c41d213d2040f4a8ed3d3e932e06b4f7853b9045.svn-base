With a plethora of drugs and gang problems, public schools are the LAST place I would send my child!  No amount of parent involvement is going to solve those problems. We have a local private High school who turns out bright talented young people.  They have a 100% college acceptance rate!  That's unheard of in public schools.  So you won't get your undies in a bunch, the young people graduating from this school are from accross the race spectrum.  I'm talking black, white, brown, asian, oriental, you name it they've got it. All you commies out there can shove it right up your A$$!
