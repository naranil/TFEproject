Even if it were a good idea to separate children by learning style, one could not reasonably infer a child's learning style from their genitalia. Maybe half of boys and half of girls would do better in a competitive atmosphere, and the same in a collaborative one. But that still would not mean that society would benefit from children being spoon-fed in homogeneous groups when the real world is diverse and demands adaptation. 
To everyone who thinks girls are better off in single-sex schools so that they don't invest time in being sexually desirable to men, I would note that we might be better off working toward a society where girls don't see themselves as sex objects, rather than designing institutions that say, "we think you can't learn around boys because you would have to spend so much time being a sex object." I went to school with boys but somehow I managed to see myself as a human being and to retain higher goals than being pretty. 
Test scores would be an astoundingly poor way to judge the merits of single-sex education anyway. Testing well is not the goal. Succeeding in life is the goal. I shudder to imagine the losses we'd suffer in reducing the gender gap in the remaining boys' clubs like engineering and high level business management if women had to deal with men who had never in their lives had the experience of cooperating with a woman. Or being bested by her. 
We have a few thousand years of evidence for how poorly men treat women when women are excluded from male institutions.
