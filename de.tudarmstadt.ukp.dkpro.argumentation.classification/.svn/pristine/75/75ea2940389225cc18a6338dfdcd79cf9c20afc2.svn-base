Ohhhh, here we go again!!!! Where ever the Muslims go, they expect "special" treatment. No religion in schools....this is what we've come to. In order to keep everyone satisfied, there should be no religion in schools. If parents want their children to have religion, they are going to have to teach them at home or in their places of worship. Too bad, if the Muslim children don't come back to classes after their prayers. That's their problem, not the school's. For goodness sake, it's just awful. Time was, the school day started with a prayer, and yes, maybe religion classes, but not nowadays..there would be full scale war. If the textbooks contain any reference to God, there's trouble, and if the teachers happen to make any kind of a reference to God, or religion..or the hereafter..or what ever may have any religious connotation, the children tell their parents and the parents complain!!!! So there you have it....yet more proof the multiculturalism doesn't work!! Thanks Mr. Trudeau; you've laid the goundwork that's the cause of making life in Canada a living hell...oh heck..was that a religious inference!!!!!!
