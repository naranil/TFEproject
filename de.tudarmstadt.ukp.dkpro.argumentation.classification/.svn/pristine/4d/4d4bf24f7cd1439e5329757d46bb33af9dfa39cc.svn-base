My son turned 5 one week before the cut-off. He is in a full day Kindergarten and seems to be doing well, considering he is the youngest in the class. Last year, his pre-school teacher recommended that I hold him back and keep him in Pre-K one more year. Pre-K was only 3 hours long, while Kindergarten was a full day. My husband and I agreed, that if our son has to be held back, it will be when we're sure he's not keeping up with the kids and Pre-K is not that time. He would have been bored going over the same things and not getting challenged. He has had no problems so far in Kindergarten. I'm happy with my choice and it was comforting to read this article of support for my decision.
