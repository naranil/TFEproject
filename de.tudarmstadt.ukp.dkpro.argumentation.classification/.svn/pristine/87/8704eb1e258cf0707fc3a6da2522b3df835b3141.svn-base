Wow, here we go again. Christians blaming moral decline on prayer being taken out of school. How pathetic. Are we so weak minded? Japan, where no one prays at school, has the lowest crime rate of any developed nation. I mean, c’mon! Even Jesus was against school prayer. Matt 6:5-6 Anyways, children can pray in school if they want to. That right hasn’t been taken away, they merely need to keep it to themselves. It just isn’t fair to have prayer required in schools. What about the other children who believe in a different religion or have no religion? But, of course. These types of Christians only care about themselves and THEIR beliefs. To hell with everyone else. Inconsiderate bigots.
