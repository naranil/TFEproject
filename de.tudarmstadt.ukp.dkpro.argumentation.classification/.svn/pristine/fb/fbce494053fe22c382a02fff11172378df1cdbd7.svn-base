Why are the people "Bad People" who send their kids to private school?  Quite judgemental on your part don't you think.  Who put you in charge of who's good and bad because of the choices they make for their children.   Just because YOU don't like it doesn't equal "bad people".  You seem to think VERY highly of youself to be able to judge a persons character by what type of school the send their kids to. The beautiful thing about America is that everyone should have the personal freedom to choose private school, pubic school( which everyone is required to support weather they like it or not BTW through taxes)  or to homeschooling.  The only "bad people" in my opinion would be the people who believe..  that the overcrowded public school system should be the ONLY way.  our taxes already support the schools now the "bad people" believe the only way to make the schools better is to send children from private school to public?  Are they going to be teaching the classes?  how would that make it better?
