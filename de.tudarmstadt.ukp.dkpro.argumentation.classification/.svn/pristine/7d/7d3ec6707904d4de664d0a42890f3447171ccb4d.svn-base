Yes, you have to swear an oath for jury duty. First when you fill out the papers at jury selection that what you are stating is the truth and then in court during the selection process. After you're picked, you're required to raise your right hand and repeat the the oath. I can't recall if "so help me god" was included in that oath or not. 
I know depending on who's swearing you in in the military, SHMG will be left out as well.
