There are some kids who thrive in public schools and some kids thrive in private schools. Some kids would not be able to handle the work load of a private school. One of the biggest differences is that public schools teach to a test and want the children to make the school system look good. Private schools challenge the kids to make the child look good, thus making them look good. The public school systems are so big that some very bright kids fall through the cracks because they do not "fit the mold". I know, I have one of each.
