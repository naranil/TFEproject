It's individuals like that who take away the right to choose and assuming it's just rich people who send their kids shows the ignorance in that statement. In fact many middle class and even lower income folks use private education for their children. It also bids the argument that religion plays a roll and it's an obvious attack against those schools who are affiliated that way. Why not use public schools here are a couple reasons they teach liberal sex education, they teach evolution, they teach homosexuality generally at an early age, and some even hold classes about  certain religions. Each of these examples are a bias when there is no balance or equal time given to educate other views in the public schools. Lastly, every person sending their children to private schools will pay for public schools as well through local taxing especially if real estate taxes fund that government system too. It's been proven that the per student cost basis in public schools is much higher than private schools.   Sandy
