Prayer in schools should not be led by a school official (who is a gov't official if we are talking about public schools). Students can pray all they want together or by themselves, and very few people actually argue against this, at least I think. 
I see no reason why kids need to have a school-led prayer, or a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, for that matter.
