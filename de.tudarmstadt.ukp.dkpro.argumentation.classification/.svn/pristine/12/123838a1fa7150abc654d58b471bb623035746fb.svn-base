Why is religion a less compelling reason to send your child to a private school?  And what does the author make of parents living in an excellent public school district yet opt to send their kids to private school?  And is the author conceding that private schools are, in fact, better than public schools; at least to an extent that she wants to move the private school kids to the public schools in order to make public schools better.   If this was cold war Russia and not present-day United States of America, her argument would make absolutely perfect sense.
