The school board's decision is having the exact opposite effect of what they intended..This political correctness is making people less tolerant, creating hard feelings and driving an even bigger wedge between people..Thousands of different religions in this world but everyone seems to think that their religion is the only one that counts... Religion is basically a gang mentality where people feel they need to belong to a group...Get it out of public schools
