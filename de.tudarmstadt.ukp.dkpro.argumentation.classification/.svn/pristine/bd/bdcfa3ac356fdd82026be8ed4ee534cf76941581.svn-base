I do not think the public schools modify their operations or plans quickly enough.  Private schools do that, or the tuition money dries up.  In the past, Unions protected crummy teachers not only from being fired, but from criticism that would have netted an improvement in teaching or at least sufficiently obvious reasons for the teacher to get a new gig.  This is changing, but too slowly.  Private schools fire bad teachers with a quickness, but are still tolerable of the faculty member who has a bad day or a bad week.  Both will close ranks to help out a teacher who could use a hand.  Public schools are more democratic, private schools are fascist.  Public schools must accept all people (but not all behaviors, and it takes a while to remove problem students), whereas private schools get to choose their students.  Private schools tend to be smaller, and the teachers have more interaction with the kids, which allows for a sense of unity to develop.  Public schools tend towards obesity - they are too large for their own good, and for the good of the students - trimming the schools down to under four hundred kids would be better.  Stop zoning kids out of schools, where some kids end up in money-dominated demographics and other kids end up in poverty-dominated demographics.  And above all, give me more hours in the day to call and email and communicate with parents and civic groups.
