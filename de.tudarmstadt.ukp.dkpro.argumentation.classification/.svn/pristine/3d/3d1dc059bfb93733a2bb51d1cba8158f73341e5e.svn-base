I will be using this article for my school assignment as well. Not because I am pro prayer in school but because I got stuck with the topic. Honestly i think that if people want to pray on their own time let them. But why must we have a mass function to pray? What about those who don't believe? Do you really need the whole school to pray at one time to reinforce your beliefs. If morality is declining its because of religion not getting taught in the home well. School has nothing to do with it
