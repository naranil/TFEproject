I sent my kid to private school so that she could get a better education. She was at a public school that was 90% hispanic. The problem was not their race but the fact that they were way behind in reading langauge and math. This situation was holding my kid and preventing her from excelling in her studies. Do you think I should of just left my kid in this class? Give me a break!
