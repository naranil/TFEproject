There are good and bad in this argument. Just because a parent(s) can afford to send their kids to a private school doesn't mean they are more or less involved with their kids schooling. Some send the kids to private schools because they can't/won't be bothered with getting invovled. Others because the can and have more say in the schools teachers and curriculum than they do in the public schools. And most public school administrators don't want to fight teachers unions over a bad teacher, nor take the time and put forth the effort to fire one so they continue to teach. No one should blame a parent for wanting the best education for their child, and certainly you can argue that if all parents had their kids in public schools they would be better, but that is not reality and there is no way one can logically argue that, nor should people blindly believe it. There are politics in education and when the school system is overseen by a bunch of ineffectual congressional leaders that can't agree on anything, how can Allison really believe it will make a difference?
