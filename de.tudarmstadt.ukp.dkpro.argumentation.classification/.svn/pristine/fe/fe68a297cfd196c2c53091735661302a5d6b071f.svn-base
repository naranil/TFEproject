I do impose. We eat together as a family as often as we can. My girls know how to use a knife and fork. They mainly say please and thank you. 
As far as dialogue happens, I encourage it as much as possible. Our children participate fully in our family life. We are not bourgeois, we are a normal family. 
You comment about parent represention is interesting. Do you not influence your children in many different ways. Does not school do the same? The point is, is school does it to the Governments prescription. In our house, we can have the question we can investigate it together for as long as we need to, and come up with a mutually acceptable conclusion, or we all make our own conclusions. At least we can do it at our pace, not 50 mins, move on its now whaterver.
