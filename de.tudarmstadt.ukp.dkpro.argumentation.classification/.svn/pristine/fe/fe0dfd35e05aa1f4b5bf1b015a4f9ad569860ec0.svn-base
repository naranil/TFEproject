This writer obviously doesn't know anything about the public school system.      She doesn't know how public schools are funded, by what she writes if you don't send you're kids to school there you don't pay for it. That's not true, public cost comes mainly from property taxes even if you don't have kids. If people followed her advice, there would be massive over crowding in the public schools, making it a lot worse for all kids.      Does she even live in the U.S., what a moron !!!
