Here's the deal:  Private school teachers are not union employees and do not receive government funds.   Public schools are staffed by union employees and get their money from taxpayers to be pissed away by union school superintendents. If you don't have a decent private school, parents look for another private school to take their kids.   If you don't have a decent public school, Obama takes MORE taxpayer money to piss away on weenie wussy programs that make public school into little more than government funded day cares.
