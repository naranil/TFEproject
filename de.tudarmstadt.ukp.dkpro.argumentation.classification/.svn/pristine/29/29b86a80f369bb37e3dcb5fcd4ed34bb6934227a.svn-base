MO - I don't understand how redshirting in your area is so common but all the parents are agonizing over the decision. 
It's really not a hard concept to understand. People agonize over it because people here don't tend to redshirt for reasons like age or size. People want to make sure that they are not redshirting for reasons like they want little Mikey to be the oldest kid in the class or the biggest on the football field. They have concerns over developmental, emotional, social or academic issues and they want to make sure that when they do make the decision to hold their child out of school, that it truly is in the best interest of the child.
