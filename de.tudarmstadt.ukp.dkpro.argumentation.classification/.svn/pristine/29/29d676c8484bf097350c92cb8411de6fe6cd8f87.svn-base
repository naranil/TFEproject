Ok....if you're going to make a point based on a snap shot (parents blame game) and consider what you see "big picture", how relevant is this story? The real story in many public school systems in the US is accessibility resources not meeting the standards of local and state municipalities all the while producing less than the worlds youngest and brightest. Environmentally speaking, many buildings are not up to code (health risk – air quality), are burdensome regarding devalued property (dilapidated), a generator of many things bad (dietary, etc.), teacher’s salaries, unions, and the list goes on. I side with the author on overcoming against the odds (with proper support). This factor is not one that fits the mold of the average person and not should be taken lightly as it does not apply to the average U.S. citizen. I sense the notion that public education isn’t required to be performed in a traditional school setting but may/should take place at the home with the parent(s).  So “YES”, parents are wrong for paying taxes for participating in a, not failing, but “failed” public education system. Parents are obligated to be advocates for their children. Moving to a better zip code is not the option for the vast majority. Here’s the kicker, what level of commitment is required to educate in the home? Do most households have the elements for educating students? Social development is very much needed in today’s global/international market(s). There’s no easy answer. To say parents are at fault is an easy way to get feedback/pulse in order to extract information from readers. No true experienced writer is this naive! Our nation is faced with deciding quality of the short vs. long-term future and fabric of our nation. Taxes vs. balanced books/budgets are an ever growing challenge. The short cut to success in the eyes of attaining $/wealth is to require history classes of how the top 1% became the top 1% for K-12 grades. If you’re home schooled, attend public or private school, the exposure to what actually works and what it takes/took to reach the top is the reality students need to understand as well as parents. For those is think and say $/wealth is not everything, I suggest “power” be the topic! Don’t be fooled …”the schools will get better”. Better at what? The reshaping of this great nation will be more than attaining $/wealth. Sustainability on most if not all fronts must be the goal! Sorry to have carried on but I don’t think the author of this article considered the audience to have been entrenched in the rearing of children. However, I urge K. Wong to publish a strong comeback article given the feedback I’ve seen from readers. Note: if the K. Wong is a parent who has actually tried this and is a witness to things having improved by taking her own children from private school (whom in many cases exposes students closure to the 1%) and placing them in a public low performing school, I say that history tells us that those who derail from what’s “norm” make it to the top 1%! If you don’t do all you can for your children regarding education, it will show. If your children do not take to the education you’ve provided it will show.
