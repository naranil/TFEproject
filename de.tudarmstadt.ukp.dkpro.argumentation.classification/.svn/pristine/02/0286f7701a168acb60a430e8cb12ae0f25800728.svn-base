I don't have an answer for you OP but i do have some points for considerations.
- Think longer term...high school is year 7-12 - Also think if you are intending for her to attend a select high school like Macrobertson Girls. - Personal opinion is Balwyn High is better academically from what i hear - Transport options? - Fees? I think Canterburry would be more... - Time investment? some schools expects parents to do everything eg. working bees, fates etc. - What about her friends? going to the same school as your primary school friend will help you adjust much quicker. 
I'd go and talk to parents of both schools and see how they rate it.
good luck and let me know what you decide.
cheers
