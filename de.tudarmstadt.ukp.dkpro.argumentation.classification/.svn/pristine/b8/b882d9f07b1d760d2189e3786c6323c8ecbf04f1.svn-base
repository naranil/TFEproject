I have a great solution to this problem - 3 day weekends anyone?
I mean why not? Christian prayer in schools is not a problem because the Christian holy day of the week is Sunday - a day when there is no school. In Canada, no Christian would ever have to choose between going to Sunday service, and going to school. 
Jewish prayer in schools is not a problem, because their Holy day is Saturday, also a day when there is no school. 
So if we add Friday to the weekend, then Muslims can go to the mosque on Friday, and not have to choose between going to school, or going to worship. Done!
