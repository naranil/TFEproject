I can see the benefits of both types of schooling for differnt children. I think it must be a mindfield for parents having to make this choice and despair at the battles they face for funding appropriate eductation for their children. I was a paediatric Occupational Therapist and worked in both special needs schools and mainstream environments and saw successes and failiures in both. One secondary school had a great system with a unit attached with a high ratio of TA's to children. The kids intergrated into the lessons they were able to and had lessons within the unit. They were able to mix with their peers of all abilities at break times. Those with physical disabilitys but no additiona learning needs were fully intergrated into the class but because of the inclusive nature and an excellent senco adaptations could be made, e.g IT provision in every lesson, access to a scribe, extended time to sit exams and submit homework, leaving lessons a few minutes earlier to avoid the crush in the corridors. I ran life skills groups and was always part of any meetings about trips, work experience, careers etc. 
I now work as a TA with a child with CP who is placed in a mainstream school appropriately so because despite physical and communication difficulties is very bright. However I feel that the school struggles to meet her needs due to lack of experience and always fighting for funding.
