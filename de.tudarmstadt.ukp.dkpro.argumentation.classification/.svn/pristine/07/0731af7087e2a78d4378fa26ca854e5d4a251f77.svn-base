The public schooling system is not as bad as some may think. Some mentioned that those who are educated in the public schools are less educated, well I actually think it would be in the reverse. Student who study in the private sector actually pay a fair amount of fees to do so and I believe that the students actually get let off for a lot more than anyone would in a public school. And its all because of the money. 
In a private school, a student being expelled or suspended is not just one student out the door, its the rest of that students schooling life fees gone. Whereas in a public school, its just the student gone. 
I have always gone to public schools and when I finished I got into University. I do not feel disadvantaged at all.
