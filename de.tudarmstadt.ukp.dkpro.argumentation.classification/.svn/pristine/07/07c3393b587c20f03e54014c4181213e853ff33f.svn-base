There are many intricate details when making decisions in regards to drawing the line when separation is required. That said, should the decision have been made by one person I would understand and cut that person some slack. None of us are perfect. What bothers me here is that this appears to have been a group decision. That is scary for rest of us. Please stop, reverse your decision and realize that religion, all religions, have no use in our education system, our government and technically speaking (even those whom are dedicated to their faith) 98% of the hours with a calendar year. Our society just isn't gear for that. Ultimately, we as a society lose.
