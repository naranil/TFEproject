IT IS NOT DOLLARS!!!    It's the parents commitment.  In our town the public schools are great! But, parents are involved and there is ZERO tolerance for bad behavior.  The school has a modified grading system...A 93% is a "B", a 87% is a "C" and a 81% is a "D".  The town has 7.5% unemployment , 45% of the kids on assisted lunch program and Average per capita income of under $45K/year.   It can be done if the parents and school work together!   30% of last years seniors graduated with honors.   IT CAN BE DONE and it isn't DOLLARS!
