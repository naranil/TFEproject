I have students in both private and public schools.  When I heard my daughter (in 8th grade at a public school), who has to work very hard to get slightly above avg. grades say "the kids are such a distraction in the classroom and I can't concentrate/work.  And the teachers can't do anything about it." That was all it took for me to send her to the private school where the learning environment is better and the teachers can do something about it. I don't disagree the author about the parents driving change but guess what?  When my daughter has a 4 year window in HS to succeed or not to succeed, I don't have time to drive the change that typically take years.
