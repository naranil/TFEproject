This idea of hers that wealthy people send their kids to private schools shows just how little she knows. We put four kids through private school on a truck drivers salary while my wife stayed home to be there for them when they needed her to. It wouldn't matter how much money was pumped into the public school system it would still be a mess. Last time I checked this was still a free country meaning we are free to send our children to school where we choose. Free from the control of a ever increasing too powerful federal goverment . PS Hey NSA keep this under file if you like.
