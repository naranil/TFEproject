That will do it, I know some young women that went either way when they hit uni, some went a bit crazy with the new found freedom, some really blossomed. 
After reading through the thread, i thought i would drop in and put my 2c.
I went to a co-ed public high school and in senior there was certain classes that where known to be 99% guys and it put off some of the women from going into those streams. 
While it's not that bad these days, if you are going into mech eng, IT depending on the personalities involved I can see it being off putting being the only girl in a class 25 guys at that age.
