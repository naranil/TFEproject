Yes, but...   I taught in public schools for 12 years because I believe in the idea of a free and democratic education. In reality, public schools are a quagmire of small-town politics and administrators trying to get ahead; in the current iteration, they have nothing to do with what is best for kids and everything to do with getting one's name on the top of the letterhead. I tried for 12 years to change this and failed. My kid, languishing in a "good" public school, was getting stupid and lazy. I quit, started my own school and now I see her thrive every day.   The whole mission of public school needs to change, and for that to happen minds need to change, and there are just too many people out there who believe worksheets and standardized testing are the way to go. Until that mindset shifts, public school won't change, regardless of how many wealthy parents come back. It's not just about money.
