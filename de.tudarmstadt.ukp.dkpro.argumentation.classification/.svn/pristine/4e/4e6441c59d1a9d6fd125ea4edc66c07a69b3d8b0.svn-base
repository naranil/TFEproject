I love that this article gets blamed for the "liberal agenda." It is the same argument against the Affordable Care Act. Each of us thinks that we can only think of ourselves and some how our communities will prosper? Public education is about our ability as a nation to progress, yes progress, into the future. Without everyone being educated, this whole nation falls apart. No education, no jobs, no economy. Those that can afford private school are blessed there is no denying that, but they are also part of a community and a nation. Paying taxes is fine and good, but if you believe the teachers are bad... the best way to fix that is to get into a teacher's face each day and push them to give your child the best. Paying for private school avoids the larger problem in our country and anyone that doesn't have a child should probably stay out of the discussion. Vouchers will drive the participation out of the public sector. That's what everyone is bitching about... in the end, no on trusts government because it has no morals and in doctrines your children to be more progressive. Face it, in one generation, same-sex marriage will be legal, we will continue to have minorities for elected officials and yes, public school will continue because of people like me and the FAITH I have in the United States of America!!
