My teenagers have attended private schools their entire life. I am not rich, in fact I receive a scholarship for both of my children otherwise I would not be able to afford the tuition. The remaining tuition is a sacrifice but well work it. One of my children has dyslexia. The public school system told me she would receive a certificate of completion. I'm proud to say she will soon be receiving her DIPLOMA from a private school.
