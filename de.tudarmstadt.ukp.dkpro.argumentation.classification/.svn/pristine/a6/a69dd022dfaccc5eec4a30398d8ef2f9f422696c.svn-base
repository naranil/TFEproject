6 questions. Just putting them out there, for the room....
1) What the hell does this even mean?
2) Is there actually anyone who doesn't blame the mother and her partner?
3) Has anyone anywhere actually been accused of hate speech for doing so?
4) No seriously, anyone?
5) Even by implication?
6) Do people who take up armchair warfare against the phantom PC menace ever stop and listen to themselves?
