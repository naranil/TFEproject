This is probably the worst argument against private schools that I have ever heard. Let's think about this rationale for a moment......  Let's simplify this and replace private schools with restaurants. If you ate at a restaurant and the service was horrible, the food was bad, the establishment was dirty, etc., would you go back? Most likely you would not return. In fact you would probably make a mental note never to eat there again and maybe even tell a few of your friends about your experience. You certainly wouldn't recommend it. I don't know how anyone would come to the conclusion that if they just continued to patronize the restaurant and support it and make donations that the restaurant would improve. That's ridiculous, logically you would move on and find somewhere else to eat. It would take weeks, months, and sometimes years to implement necessary changes to make the public school system better and that's IF you can get all the board members, educators, parents, political figures, etc. to agree on what's best, what direction to go in, how to do it, and so on and so on. Meanwhile your children are not getting their needs met and they are growing up, fast. Why would you sacrifice your child's education? I wouldn't, I would go elsewhere, somewhere where I knew my children were getting what they deserve.  On a side note, you don't have to be wealthy parents to send your kids to a private school, if you do your research you'll find that many private schools provide scholarships. So there aren't as many "wealthy parents" out there as Ms. Benedikt would have you believe. Besides, those parents are still paying taxes to the public education system and their children are NOT utilizing those funds. Even with the extra money there are still no results. Ms. Benedikt must have gone to a public school, her reasoning doesn't make any sense. I think she was was of those kids that "slipped between the cracks".
