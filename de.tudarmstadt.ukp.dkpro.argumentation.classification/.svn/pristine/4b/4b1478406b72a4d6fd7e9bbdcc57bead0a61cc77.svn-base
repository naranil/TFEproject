I am in a similar situation. My son is not old enough for public kinder, but I can register him at the private one in the school that I am teaching at. So I have the choice of a THIRD year of preschool, or being the youngest in kinder. I still haven’t made a choice yet, and my plan is to register him for both, and choose sometime in august, when I have a better idea of what is better for him. He is academically ready (knows all his letters, upper and lower case, writes them all with little assistance, does simple math, etc) but he’s not so socially ready. He still has trouble making friends, and navigating social situations. And he still has trouble separating at the beginning of the school day (or transitioning in general). 
My thinking is that if you send them to kinder a year early, you can always have them repeat kinder, it’s better than having them repeat 1st grade.
