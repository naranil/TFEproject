*Why would it irritate you for a family to "work the system" in order to provide the best possible education for a child?* 
The same way it irritates me when people cheat to get something for their child that wouldn't be available to children in general? I consider that poor play, regardless of where it occurs. 
A resident of a school district who utilizes a service or program that the school district offers is not, in any way, cheating. That's just ridiculous.
