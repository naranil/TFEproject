Note that Finland has one of the best educational levels without private schools.
Note that Finland has one of the world's most rigorous teacher training and selection process in the world and all teachers must hold a masters degree. Hardly comparable. 
Note. Finland has 80% of parents taking their child to a library EVERY weekend !
Note 3.8% of Finland's population is foreign born compared to 26% of Australia's. Many parents are unable to read the (English) books in their local library to their children 
The fact that Finnish teachers have good educational standards and their parents care about education hardly invalidates the central point that Finland actually lifted its educational standards (to among the highest in the world) after they virtually abolished private schools. The arguments that parents should be encouraged to support education and teachers should be highly qualified are, of themselves, clearly valid (incidentally, Finnish teachers are also 95% unionised, before anyone gets into bashing teacher unions). The relatively monocultural and monolingual nature of Finland probably does make the educational task somewhat easier, but the only way that can affect the public/private debate is by admitting that private schools can discriminate against NESB students. Incidentally, have a look at the names of top achievers in selective public schools - not too many Anglos, so that's a 2-edged sword as well.
