Well the Federal Government got involved and that is what has ruined schools.  Also school has dumbed down since I went.  Now the government is talking about kids being obese so we have to have health food.  Its not so much what they eat as much as what they do! When I was in grade school we had Recess in the morning, then lunch at noon and after we ate we were taken out side and walked around the baseball field.  Then we had P.E and did some kind of activity.  Now days they do not do as much activity at school or at home.  Now days kids want to sit and play xbox, Nintendo, computers, ipads, or ipods or ride four wheelers when they should be out playing or riding bicycles.  I part yea parents need to take an active role in their child's health and education, but if the school fails to sucks then let them put them in private school.  My child goes to public school, and if the school starts to suck then guess what I'll send her to private school to get a better education Because sometimes you just can't fix stupid!
