I wonder if the author has looked into the parents personal experiences when it comes to "redshirting". Are the parents holding their children back till they are 6 the same parents who were put into Kindergarten when they were 4?? I, myself, was started in Kindergarten at 4 back in the 80's when the cutoff was 5 by January 1st. Now with my daughter, who has a September birthday, I'm torn between starting her with just a few days/weeks of 4 left or holding her out for an entire year. 
For me (and perhaps for other parents) its not KINDERGARTEN that is the issue, but later in life that is...
