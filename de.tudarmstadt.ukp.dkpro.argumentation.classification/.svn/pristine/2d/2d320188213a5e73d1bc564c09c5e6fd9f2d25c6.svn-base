So if a company is terrible, I guess I should keep buying from that company so they can make profits to make their product better.  And I can make that company better by buying their lousy product so they get money and also giving them my opinions to make their product better????   Better yet, how about we banish all private schools and only have government schools.  Have you seen the quality of buildings and cars made by countries that do not have any competition with state run organizations. The quality is terrible,  despite the benefit of getting all of the money and no competition.   Company's that are bad will get motivated to get better when they lose business.  Also, my main concern right now, is my children's education.  Any improvement in our schools, if they were to happen,  will be long after my kids grow up.  I am bad if I sacrifice my kids education for some philosophy.  When our country hardly had any private K - 12 schools, did our public schools get better.  So why should it be any different now.
