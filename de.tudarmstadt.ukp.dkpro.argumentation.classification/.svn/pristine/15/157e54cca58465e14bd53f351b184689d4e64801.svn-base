You miss the point entirely lady. For example: 1. Its not OK to entirely have taken God out of schools. 2.People don't want their children indoctrinated with leftist crap. 3. The government should not be in the education business. 4. The government can't get anything right. And the list goes on....yeah, read the tea leaves...its a message to you and ppl like you and the public education system...they are telling you to go jump in a lake.
