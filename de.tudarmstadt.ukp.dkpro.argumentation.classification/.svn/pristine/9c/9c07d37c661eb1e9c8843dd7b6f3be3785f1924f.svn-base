The rulers in that time shouldn't have banned prayers in school,they are going to be responsible for what we are seeing today, its simple prayers in school filled with God are effective but if they are empty prayers, surely those who don't believe might do whatever it takes to destroy our christian principles, so listen up Christians don't let anyone do this! Stand up for what is right! Not what secular men say is right but you should stand up for what God thinks is right! Doesn't matter what people might say, it matters more what God says about you!
