first praying is not asking good for things like i want a bike i dont want braces its asking god for forgivness. and second catholics dont spend there whole weekend in a church praying its only one hour. one hour out of 48 is not alot. ok so i think giving five minutes up a day during school as prayer time where everyone prays in there heads i think would be ok. i go to a private catholic school and at school we pray three times it not that much and only takes up like 5 minutes total for the whole day
