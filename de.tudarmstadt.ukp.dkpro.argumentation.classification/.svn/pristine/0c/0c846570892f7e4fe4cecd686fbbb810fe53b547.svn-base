If a young five is already reading and doing basic math, they can continue to develop those skills at home for another year. That's what we are doing. She may be advanced academically, but kindy is full day and she is just not ready for that, maturity-wise. The school is having her wait, and I am 100% fine with that. 
She can keep doing her thing at home another year, and do half day preschool. They will find ways to challenge her, the curriculum is designed to accomodate all skill levels.
