I think it's a lousy article and the writer is completely wrong she needs to get to know all the parents that had there children go to private school before she starts to judge all private school parents by saying they are bad people. Most people send there kids to private school because of there religion, for example catholic schools. How can you be a bad person when your just trying to send your kid to a school where he/she can learn about the Lord, go to church and at the same time get a great education. Put that in your article Allison!
