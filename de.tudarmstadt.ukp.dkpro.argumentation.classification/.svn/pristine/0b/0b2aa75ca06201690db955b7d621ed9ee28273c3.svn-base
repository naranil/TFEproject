My twin sons made the Sept 1 cutoff by 2 days, and started K just as they turned 5. They will graduate from high school this year at 17. 
They have never had a problem being the youngest in their class - in fact, B's 2nd grade teacher didn't realize he was the youngest until March (it wasn't obvious). They have played in sports, excelled academically, and are excited about starting college in the fall. No regrets, no problems. 
Our neighbor's son is 2 months older, but was nowhere near socially ready for K at 5. A year later, he hit the ground running, and has thrived ever since. Every kid is different.
