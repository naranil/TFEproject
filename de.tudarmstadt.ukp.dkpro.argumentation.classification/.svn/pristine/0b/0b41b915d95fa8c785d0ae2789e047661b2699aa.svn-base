I just pulled my child out of public school because of the incompetent teachers there. I have always been involved in my children's education in the public school. I am a teacher myself and I give 100% of me everyday to my students but unfortunately where my kids go to school they don't. I am thank-ful I could afford to send them to a private school. I give up other things to do that. I work hard and the American way allows me to make those choices.
