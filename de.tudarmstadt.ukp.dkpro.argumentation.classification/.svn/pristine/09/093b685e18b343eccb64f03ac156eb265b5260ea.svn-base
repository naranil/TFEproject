Having taught for many years in both State and Catholic schools in not so salubrious suburbs I would make the distinction between the local systemic Catholic school and Private schools which charge exhorbitant fees. Fees at systemic schools are set by the system and vary little. I have not had many wealthy children in my classes. By the way teachers are all taught in the same institutions its the way all schools are run and how much time and effort parents put into their children's education that counts.
