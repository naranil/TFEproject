I have 2 kids born 3 years 2 days apart. One was the youngest in his class . That was a hard call because he was pretty shy until high school . Academically he did great , valedictorian when he graduated. The other is the 2nd oldest in his class. I held him back because he couldn't sit still.for 2 minutes. No self control at all. After thousands of bedtime stories and hundreds of trips to the library, books were only as good as the pictures. Not only was he not beginning sounding out letters- he really didn't know what they were for! I remember Joe telling me that the letter J looked " vaguely familiar". 
Any advantage he may have had in sports vanished as soon as the rest of the football team learned their right from their left. He's not very big and he's right in the middle of his class with school work. It would have been a horrible struggle for him to start at age 5, and he would have been held back anyway. There's a real possibility that he would have been diagnosed with a disorder when his real problem was lack of maturity. 
Anyway, I guess it's a individual decision, but I think to do it for any reason but survival is a bit shallow and probably useless. Minna
