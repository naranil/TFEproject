Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues.  I would not having a problem sending mine to public if they were learning. When I taught in NYC before NCLB, students were leveled off to their level and abilities so children can advance and not be waiting for others to catch up and learn English even.  Mine went to Public in Florida in Kindergarten and 1st and were coloring all day and playing computer games, and 1/2 the class did not speak English, in the same class! Hence, I switched to Private....So whoever this lady is saying parents are Bad for sending them to private should bite her tongue. We work hard to pay for private school education and I have been on both sides to see the difference.
