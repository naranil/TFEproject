Wanting my children to recieve a religious education is a "less compelling" reason to go to private school?    "... with being a person whose family can pay for and cares about superior education â€” the exact kind of family that can help your crappy public school become less crappy ..."   Are my children supposed to be fodder to improve the system? No thank you.
