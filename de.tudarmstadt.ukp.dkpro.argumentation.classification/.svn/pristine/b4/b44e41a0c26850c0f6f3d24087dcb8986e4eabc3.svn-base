The public schools are not going to get better. Being an involved parent with kids in public schools, it doesn't matter what policies I try to bring about, or suggestions I bring, or SAFETY CONCERNS that I have made the schools and transportation departments aware of, things will NOT change. When the average $$ amount spent on educating a child is around $12k and it costs $40k+ to house a prisoner, then that is where one of the problems lies. And people who are fortunate enough to send their children to a private school or to, even better, homeschool, are not going to make a difference. There are MANY issues with how public education is formed, and the parents sending their kids to private school, are not going to make a difference. That is up to government officials to start listening to the public and making the right changes.
