This article is bogus! Most people put there kids in private schools because the public schools are teaching in a way that people do not like. Many public schools think they are gods and work on molding kids to be Progressives. Kids are being kicked out of public schools for pretending their hand is a gun, etc. Bad article, bogus article, and the writer must be a progressive. The schools need to change, not the parents.
