Atheists will deny that our unalienable rights are God given, but if that assertion is true, then there is no sound philosophical footing to claim any unalienable rights at all. The prime purpose of law is to protect an associated right. For example, the commandment "Thou shall commit no murder" ordains the right to life and "Thou shall not steal" asserts the right to property. 
If the atheistic worldview is correct, then the only place "rights" can come then is gratuitously from the state. That would set the stage for tyranny for the state would no longer be just the earthly protector and curator of unalienable rights, but would be the divine provider of them. The state would thus have the just power to give or withdraw these rights on a whim, and they would because governments are inherently corrupt and have the power of coercion. If unalienable rights can only come from the state then there is no just reason to rebel against tyranny. Unless government has limited authority and jurisdiction under God, those unjustly oppressed by the state cannot lament that the state is ruling unjustly. 
Atheist will at least affirm that the power to govern comes from the consent of the governed, but if individuals didn't have God given unalienable rights to begin with, there would be nothing negotiable to concede to the state in order to empower the state to govern. 
As a result atheism, by virtue of his own theory of origins, is hard pressed to prove that unalienable rights exist at all and therefore can only deny them and incorrectly believe they are the exclusive domain of the state. Man is not God.
