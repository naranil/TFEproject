This woman is typical of the liberal mindset.  Sure, send your kid to an inner city school where teachers are lower salaried and less motivated. Where I live, kids have to pass through metal detectors so that they can be taught things (political views) that I personally don't believe in. People who send their kids to a private school still support the local school system through their school taxes.  This is still America and people have choice and the right to make that choice. Wong is wrong...
