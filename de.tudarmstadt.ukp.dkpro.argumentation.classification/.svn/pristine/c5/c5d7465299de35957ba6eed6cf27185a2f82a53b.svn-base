I used to work in a public high school in Burnaby, BC as a youth worker. At this high school was a teacher, who was Christian, who decided to create a Christian study group for students who wanted to join. Students joined, they created a study group and that was it, end of story.....why is this an issue at all? Are the Jews Christians or others being prevented from creating their own groups? It doesn't say that they are so why is this a story????
