I don't want to be the hate figure here, but home schooling is probably always going to be the subject of some suspicion purely because any possible abuse wouldn't be able to be reported by any other pupils or teachers. And yeah, I agree that people shouldn't be automatically deisgnated as suspects for child abuse simply because they decide on home teaching. 
However...
Removal of a child from established programs and situations (such as state education) will always raise a question mark in these times. Of course, turning up late for a doctors appointment for your child will also raise a question mark, but generally these things mean nothing in isolation (an A&E visit with a child will gain a mark, but you'll need a fair few before anyone pays any attention to it). 
And while of course the vast majority of people who home educate won't be using it as an excuse to hide the abuse of their children, there will be someone somewhere who does, and if and when that occurs the media frenzy and search for blame will occur. It's a crappy situation, and god help any social worker who haves to work that one case, because they're not even walking a thin line anymore, they're trying to dance between the clouds of child protection and respect of parental care. 
So many abuse cases show few warning signs while they occur (the ones we hear about in the press tend to be more gory or shocking than the majority), and sadly even if a child is watched by social carers for 23 hours and 59 minutes a day, a determined abuser will wait till the last minute. It's a hugely complicated situation that balances child protection and the assumption that a child's parents are the best source of protection for them (the current default position for child care). 
Frankly, I doubt that any real answer will be found on this thread. Although Im pretty sure someone will scream about how dare I assume they're abusive etc... But you either have some checking of child welfare or none. 
I've obviously not got the answers!
