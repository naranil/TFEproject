Hmmm.... Lets see here.  Should I send my kids to school where they can learn NOT how to READ, WRITE, SPELL, do MATH, SCIENCE,HISTORY, but learn how to think the way the Liberal federal government wants them too.  The hell with do they know how to read, write, etc. The question is do you agree with the homosexual agenda, do you 5th graders know how to put on a condom, Christianity is evil but don't hurt the sweet people of Isam's feeling because after all they are part of the religion of peace. So lets see I have a choice of sending my kids to a private school; or better yet of homeschooling them and raising intelligent indivuals who can think for themselves and make intelligent decisions when they become adults or I can send them to public schools and play a role in raising more federal libtard zombies who question nothing and can carry on the torch of the last two generations of people destroying this once great country. I guess I choose to be a bad person and go with private schooling. YOU WANT TO FIX THE PATHETIC PUBLIC SCHOOLS.... GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE EDUCATION PROCESS.
