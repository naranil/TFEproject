I have 3 older siblings who went to public school because at that time that was what my parents could afford.  My parents sought out the better of the public schools in our area (Washington, DC) at the time.  By the time I came along my father had his own business and was then financially able to send me to private school from Pre-K to college.  What I noticed is that my neighborhood friends that went to the local public school where far behind me academically.  The private school I went to taught me information almost two grades ahead of them.  There were smaller classes and the teacher didnt scream all day trying to keep some kind of order in the class.  I currently am a contract nurse for DC public schools and I see how these children are severely neglected and no one seems to care.  The parents can make a difference but in my opinion alot of times they only seem to rally together  when a student is killed or some extreme violence occurs at the school.  My vote is for private school.
