Dont ask pollies about their educational upbringing or even the boffins who have studied this from afar. How about finding out whats wrong with the public model from those who are intimate with it. The teachers themselves. Too many teachers in the public system are sending their children to private schools for this to be merely a class issue or being duped with flashy marketing. Theirs is probably the most informed choice of all yet we continue to have water cooler style debates based on one eyed perceptions. We may think that we are all experts on education because we ourselves attended school but the public discourse on this topic has not really heard from those truly in the know.
