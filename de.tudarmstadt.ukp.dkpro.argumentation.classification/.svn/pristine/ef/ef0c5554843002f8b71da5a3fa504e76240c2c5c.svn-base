Satan has been building his Kingdom here on earth far to long; and we as Christians need to stand up and take back what God has given us. “Our Schools.” If you know your bible, You know that Santan wants to be God. But GOD said, the earth is the Lords and everything thats in it.The people and the fullness there of. America is a Christian nation. That means Jesus Christ is the center of everything we do. And I’m ready to take it to the President of the United States if I have to. Put Prayer and the Ten commandments and everything Godly back into our school. When I was growing up, I looked forward to praise and singing hymns in class. I want to see my grandchilden honoring God in school as well.
