This writer is absolutely tyrannical and ignorant. So basically what she is saying is that she has decided that public education is the way to go for EVERYONE! Hello!!!! How about moving yourself out of the FIDEL CASTRO philosophy and into our wonderful 21 century democratic AMERICA! There are a million, gazillion, different children with all types of learning styles and exceptionalities. What works for 10 might not work for 50, obviously! Furthermore, if the parents have the financial mean (i.e. they worked their tails off to provide a certain standard of living for themselves and their children) then they are more then entitled to do as they wish with their hard earned money. Who the heck does she think she is????? I don't particularly care for regular private schools as many have an elitist air about them but I am a Christian and would love to one day be able to provide a Christian education for my son. It is my right to choose whichever education I deem to be best for my child. This writer is insane, quite frankly, to be labeling parents of private school children as "bad." Seems to me the only bad, amoral, and unGodly person, is herself.
