Hi,,
For the past 2 years my dd has been at trinity independent school, I. Rochester. It's a social school for kiddies with asd, dyslexia, dyscalclia and motor probs. Well we were self funding her due to her not being able to be statmented due to lack of funding * rolls eyes * . We got into some financial probs and the school have asked us not to return her in Jan due to the amount that's owed by us. We have tried 17 schools in Medway to try and see if they will take my dd, all have refused due to her not being statemented and them not being able to meet her needs. The lea have told me to retry for a statement and to keep dd at home until it comes thru, however this takes 6 months lol!! I really don't know what to do as I'm a full time uni student and work, I can't homeschool her. Plus her sensory needs need addressing in a strict school routine and m scared for her being taken out of this. To top things off the school knew damn well we would struggle to find her an appropriate school due to her needs, but still said they would happily have her back once statemented. I'm lost,, can anyone help me with what to do??
