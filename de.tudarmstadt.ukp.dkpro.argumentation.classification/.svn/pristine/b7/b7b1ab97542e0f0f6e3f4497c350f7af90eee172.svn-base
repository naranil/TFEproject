Indeed, this is actually what the bible encourages.
Christians were never to make spectacles out of themselves, or thier beliefs, but the bible also tells them that they would eventually be persecuted for those beliefs, and many like to make themselves spectacles so they they can then play the martyr. 
It's a whole different sort of "Attention Defict Disorder".
