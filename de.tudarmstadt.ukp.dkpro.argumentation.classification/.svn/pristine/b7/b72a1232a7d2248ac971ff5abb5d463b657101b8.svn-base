it's not about the rules, per se...although the rules are an indication of the values that the school holds. For instance, the public school in my hometown requires at least a 2 inch inseam where as the Christian school requires no more than 2 inches from kneecap....so the Christian school "rule" is more in line with a value of modesty, whereas the public school value of "please just don't show your crotch" is demonstrated in the 2 inch inseam rule. 
there are kids doing kids things no matter what school you go to. Just because kids are at a Christian school doesn't mean that you are totally avoiding drugs, alcohol, premarital sex...BUT...it is a totally different mindset from how it is approached by the school. Your kids are with their peers and teachers many more waking hours than they are with you....so I want the teachers and school to be promoting the same values and beliefs that we are at home. If they get caught up in something they are not supposed to be doing, I want there to be more than just detention or suspension...I want there to be education from their teachers and maybe even Biblical counseling as to WHY we believe premarital sex is wrong, or WHY it is important to obey the law...not just because it is the law, but based on Biblical principals.
