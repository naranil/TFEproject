I'm not sure how that is a response to my post. Do you mean by this statement that children do not have freedom of religion because they are not, as you write, full citizens? Your previous posts seem to indicate that you are against prayer in the schools because of the infringement on freedom of religion that it creates. Whose freedom of religion is infringed in mandatory school prayer sessions? 
Also, what dictates full citizenship and what does full citizenship mean? Children are minors, dependents. They cannot vote and do some other things. It is a very difficult legal problem to define the rights of children. That is why I made the post.
