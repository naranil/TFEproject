Hi Sally, I just wondered if it is a fair comparison to say that only 7% of kids in the UK are privately educated compared to the figure in Australia - because it is a little 'apple and pears'. In the UK kids in Catholic schools are within the public sector, which is not the case over here. In Australia if you want a Catholic education then you are forced to go private - but this is not the case in the UK and perhaps if it were the case their privately educated figures would go up?
