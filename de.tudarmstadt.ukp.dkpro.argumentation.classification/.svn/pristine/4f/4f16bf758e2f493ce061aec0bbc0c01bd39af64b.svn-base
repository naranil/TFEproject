SCD I agree, and what's heartbreaking is that there are a lot of teachers out there who are trying to work against the machine, but they're hamstrung by the standardized tests and financial pressure. I loved all of my kids' teachers. It isn't their fault the system they work for was specifically designed for the purpose of creating productive little factory workers. 
A great book to read is Coloring Outside the Lines by Roger Schank. It's very eye-opening.
