Propaganda - not compelling logic.   Their is no voucher program in my community - i pay for the public schools with my taxes and the actual school with my own dollars.   If I were to suddenly send my kids to public - I'd be saving money (not the school) - but I'd be not doing the best I can for my kids.   My kids are better educated  and better positioned in their life because of my personal sacrifice - pure and simple. Why should I subsidize others who don't make the same degree of personal sacrifice?
