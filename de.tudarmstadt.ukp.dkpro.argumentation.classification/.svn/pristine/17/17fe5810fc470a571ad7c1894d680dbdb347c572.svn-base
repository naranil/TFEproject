I am a homeowner and pay taxes for my public school system - HIGH taxes at that.  However I still choose to send my daughter to a private school.  Part of the reason is because of the individual attention she receives in class, public schools can no longer offer such quality time with students.  I have many friends who have their children in the public school system and I can see the difference in the education they are receiving.  My daughter started to come with homework in PreK, she learned how to read by the end of that same PreK year.  While my friends children where still learnign the alphabet.  The discipline and advanced opportunity has given her a jump start in life, something that is needed in a world that is moving so fast.  A stronge education will get you far and sorry to say our public school system is not pushing our children far enough or hard enough.  I do think it is very possible to succeed with a public education, but if you have the ability and option to better your children's future I do not see why you wouldn't.  I am not rich, and we struggle every month but my daughter's future is what I focus on!
