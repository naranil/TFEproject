I am a product of private school vs the rather run down public school around the corner from where I grew up. I later worked in an after school science program in public schools. I can attest, that if I went to these schools, I would not have been there to test these kids after school. The only way my parents could have fixed it, as the author claims would have happened, is if they quit their jobs and taught themselves. I lost all faith in our local public educators when I was repeatedly asked "You're an engineer, like on a train?" and "How do I hook this to the computer?" (speaking about the cardboard pinhole camera we had made that day with the class, with film)
