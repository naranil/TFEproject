This is bat insane?    Parents are supposed to sacrifice their kids on the altar of public education in the rather thin hope that if "everyone does it" that the schools overall will get better and THEN their kids will get a better education!!!   I send my daughter to public school but if I could afford to I would definitely send her to a nearby private school and not have to deal with lots of the problems in public schools.    And as a public school teacher I'm well aware of those problems.   No one should be expected to sacrifice their kids for the "greater good" if at all possible.
