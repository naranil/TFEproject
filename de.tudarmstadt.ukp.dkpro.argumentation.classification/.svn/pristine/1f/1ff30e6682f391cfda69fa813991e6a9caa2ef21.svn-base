In the area which I live the private school are a lot of money, you can get just as good an education (if not better) in the public schools.  So why go!!!  Keeping up with the Joneses for a lot of folks, there are also religions reasons as well as legacy.  Other then that there is not reason to sent your childern to a private school!
