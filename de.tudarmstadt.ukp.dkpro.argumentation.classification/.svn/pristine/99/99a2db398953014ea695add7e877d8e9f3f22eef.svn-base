I've had my children in parochial school, switched to public and now a charter school.  Our family switched back to the charter school after doing exactly what the writer suggested.  We put all of our effort into making the system better, joined every group, volunteered at the school and all events.  Reality sunk in.  Very little changed with all our efforts. Teachers voted against everything us as parents were trying to accomplish.  So we had to do what was best for our children by finding a school that fit the same values we were trying to instill in our children.  We aren't interested in whether you like it or not. Sometimes some of us are trying to make the world a better place starting with our children.
