Honestly? I felt I was letting both sides down when teaching in an inclusive secondary in London. Preparing special work for the ADHD / Autistic / severely limited children was not a problem, a joy, really, and my job! BUT teaching in a class of 35 without support was silly. A TA once a week in my lessons for an sutistic boy was NO GOOD. A TA once a week for a severly ADHD boy who became violent was NO GOOD. 
I wasn't equipped to deal with a lad with lowered learning and physical disabilities that meant he "broke" really easily either, and seeing him fitting and falling from the chair in my lesson easily rates as one of the scariest moments of my life, until the support got there. 
I don't think it works, unless all classes are small (15 max) and all children with needs have one to one help. I often spent 20 mins of each year 9 lesson getting the boys to stop aggravating the ADHD boy, as he would then "blow", much to the amusement of everyone. I didn't feel equipped to teach him and he got nothing from my lessons, and when he was "blowing" neither did anyone else. 
I feel quite strongly that these students deserve education and mixing with others, but mainstream is not the way. They deserve better.
