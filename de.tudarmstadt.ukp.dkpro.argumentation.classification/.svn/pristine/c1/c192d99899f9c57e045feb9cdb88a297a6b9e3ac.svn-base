The ability for a parent to change a system is minimal. I could have afforded to send my child to private school--I sent her to public school, knowing that I probably could overcome the system, could save my money, and could more easily afford to send her to college. Would I do it again? NO.   One is classified by the public school as one of the following: mentally ill, a "helicopter" parent, a troublemaker. Schools don't want to work with parents. If one gets together with a group of parents to make things better--that group will probably dissolve quickly due to the school administration siding with the more minor members of the group, giving their children the first and best of the goodies to get them to disrupt and help to dissolve the parental membership.   I disagree with this article--the best thing, individually, is to vote with one's feet by pulling the kids out of the schools and either putting them into private schools or home-schooling. There is too much administration in most systems--and those people make so danged much money (more than the POTUS or a Congress member) that they aren't about to play fair or work with parents. No--one has to just leave. It's the only real way to affect change--as they lose money for every student that they lose.   Just homeschool if you can't afford private schools--changing public schools is a Quixotian effort.
