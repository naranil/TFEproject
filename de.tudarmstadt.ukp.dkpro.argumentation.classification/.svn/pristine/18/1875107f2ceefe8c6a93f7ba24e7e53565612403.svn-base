The flaw.  The author assumes  parents can change a public system.  This is not so.  If it were the ins and outs of the school would be to serve the parents..it is not it is to serve and teach the children.   As such this leaves little room for parental suggestion let alone parental say in the class. The say and decisions are directed by leader of the system who reports to the state education system...not to parents.  This is where money talks, if you want to make a change or have a say in your child's education this will take either you teaching them yourself or paying someone else to teach them the way you believe is best (private school).
