However, one thing that really grated on me was the repeated mantra, "black boys are failing". Yes, statistics have shown that at GCSE level black boys may not be performing as well as they could be. 
Or in other words some black boys are failing. (Nobody ever suggested that it was all black boys). 
Incidentally I note that you too are happy to indulge in generalisations since you note (with approval) the comment made by a trainer that it is "white working class boys" who are failing? 
You mean ALL of them...?
