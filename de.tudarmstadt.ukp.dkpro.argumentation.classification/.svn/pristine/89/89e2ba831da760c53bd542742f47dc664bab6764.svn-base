You honestly cannot tell the difference in the ages of the kids. Every once in a while a child might stand out but it's not that often and the reason they are standing out is usually not because they seem "older" or "younger" 
I don't necessarily disagree with you. So the question is: Why do people hold their kids out a year when the District says this is when the kids go? If you really can't tell - why don't you just follow the rules? 
FWIW - I think for many kids you can tell in kindergarten and first. But being at the tail end of this, you can't tell after that. Every single solitary teacher I've spoken to about this says that any differential based upon age pretty much disappears by the time the child is in 3rd grade. I can see it right now at the end of second grade - to the extent there were differences because she was so young are completely eliminated. The teacher says she can't tell any difference at all.
