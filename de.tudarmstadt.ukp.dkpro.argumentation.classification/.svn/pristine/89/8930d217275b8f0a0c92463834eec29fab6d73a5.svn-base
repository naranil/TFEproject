What she says is probably true. The more affluent parents would probably make the public school "less crappy". But, why should they be expected to submit their children to a "less crappy" school when they can have a good school. Of course, if you believe in communism, then everyone should be required to endure "less crappy" schools which would consistently degenerate into full fledged "crappy"!
