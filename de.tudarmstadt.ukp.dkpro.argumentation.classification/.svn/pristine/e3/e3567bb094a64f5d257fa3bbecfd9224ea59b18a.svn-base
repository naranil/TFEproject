Education is like a genii in a bottle. The defined purpose is the wish, the students and the genii. 
Only highly moral people can have liberty, and only those educated for a high morality can be highly moral. We stopped transmiting our culture and stopped educating for good moral judgement, and began producing products for industry. 
I think the focus on literacy is like being fasinated when the tide recedes and rushing onto the ocean floor to get a better look. I think we seriously need to discuss why would educate anyone? Who is in favor of the US being like the Borg? Is the dream of democracy so completely dead, none can understand the importance of educating for it? How much can things be than people doubting if life has meaning? This is the mentality for war that got is in Iraq, and this the result of education for a technological society with unknown values. It is education for the New World Order, and that is not a democracy.
