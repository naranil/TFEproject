No matter how you try to argue this....there will be people one side or other.  I live in a district with excellent public schools and we still send our children to a private school.  Neither the private or public school is without positives and negatives.  Parenting begins at home with the schools being an aid in the parenting process.   If you don't want to take responsibility for every aspect of your child's life then what happens then the job of the public or private educator becomes increasingly harder and more expensive.
