Well of course homeschool children go to a class here or there of some sort, join homeschool co-ops, community sports leagues etc. I don't think they are chained in the basement. I'm just saying it's still not the same "overall" learning experience and independent experience as being on your own for school, making more decisions year after year without your parents input or direct involvement, it's a growing experience in other ways that aren't so much involved in homeschooling. 
I'd argue that a college-bound homeschooled teenager, who studies the expectations and requirements of different colleges, charts her own plan for how to meet them, studies her subjects and skills in a variety of settings, and moves around town throughout the day having academic and personal experiences is developing more independence than one who goes to the same building every day, with the same group of students, taking the courses on the track that the high school has already laid out, is developing.
