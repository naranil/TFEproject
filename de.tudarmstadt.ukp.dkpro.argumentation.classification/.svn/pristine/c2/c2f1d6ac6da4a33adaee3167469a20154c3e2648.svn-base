I can’t help myself, but I need to correct some errors that I read from an earlier post, post #7, the 7th down (Patrick’s). It was Caesar Constintine, who turned Rome into a Christian state, not Alexander and he outlawed the persecution of Christians, he didn’t pursecute those who were not. And it was the “Catholic church”, not the “Church” (the church made up of all of the believers) that was straying from what the apostles had taught and were running the state, and the reformation took place during the end of the Renaissance to the beginning of the Baroque periods, not the Medieval period. And the separation of church and state in the constitution, was so that a goverment couldn’t tell a person how to worship, not the other way around. And the question is never “what is best for Christiantity”, because Christ is who He is and He never changes, nor does His word. You are either a Christian, because you have believed on Him and trusted Him as your savior (a Christian; follower of Christ) or you haven’t (the lost; not a Christian.) I hope this helps anyone who might of been confused from earlier incorrect statements.
