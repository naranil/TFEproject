The comments are more fascinating than the article. Many folks, some of them with impressive intellectual accomplishments, would have us believe that the current era is different, that we, especially in the industrialized world, have moved beyond superstition into truly rational ways of thinking. The comments prove quite the opposite. Many people firmly believe things obviously at odds with reality. In particular, many are willing to ignore several centuries of improvements in organized education in our part of the world. 
In addition, many people refuse to accept that we can do things as a group, "society" that is, that we can't do as individuals. This does not bode well for our future, since in a very real sense we are all stuck with each other.
