I am confused as to what is causing the conflict at this school. Is it that one group is being allowed time and space to have services and others are being denied? Or is that the other groups oppose anyone have services no matter what faith they belong to? The intolerance in this comment thread is sad to see. And I'm not referring to comments against the Islam service taking place, rather the comments labeling anyone who practices a faith as superstitious and implying their faith is no more than a fairy tale. The person who makes such comments has a very narrow definition of religion and their understanding of it is is one of a very fundamental view. As a person of faith, I tend to see these attitudes as being no different then the religious fundamentalist who believes his way is the only way and all others are wrong. The argument that religion has caused more harm than good is old and rather tiring. The fact is, if religion didn't exist, evil still would be here. Those committing crimes and abuses would just be doing it with another reasoning behind it. If some of you believe you are better and more educated than others because you have no need for religion, fine but don't judge others for their beliefs. I dare say, you could take a lesson from all the world's major religions, which is simply the golden rule. Do unto others as you would have done to you. Being an atheist does not excuse you from that one! ;)
