My parents scrimped and saved to send me to a private Catholic school from K - 8. Best decision they ever made. I was ahead of my peers by high school. My study habits were much better and I was more prepared for college than most in my high school. My kids attend public school now and I detest it. Kids are taught to pass standardized exams rather than learn the material effectively. They can't bring home their books, so they rarely have homework to reinforce what they've learned in school. In fact I had one teacher tell me she didn't assign homework because the kids didn't do it anyway...WHAT? So reward the bad behavior?? I also don't agree for constant reward parties for doing everyday things. I think it sends the wrong message. The kids are coddled, have no responsibility with the school system in this area. It drives me nuts.
