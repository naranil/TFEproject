As has been mentioned by others it really depends on the child and the resources available. I am a teacher (currently SAHM) and worked in a specialist school for children with severe learning difficulties and ASD. For the majority of the children in the school, mainstream would not have been a suitable placement. Many didn't speak at all, had extremely challenging behavior and needed to access the curriculum in a very different way to how they would in a mainstream setting. Their needs can be far better met in a specialist school with specialist teachers and resources. No offended intended to teachers in mainstream settings-I just think it's a lot to ask when they may have a class of 30+ children with completely different needs to consider and limited training in SEN. In some cases, inclusion can work fantastically well. My school had an inclusion class attached to a local mainstream school. The pupils would spend the majority of the time in the inclusion classroom, but spend a few lessons a week in a mainstream class (with a known teaching assistant). They usually went in for sessions like Art, where the difference in ability is less obvious. This worked really well. I think that where inclusion is being considered, it has to be carefully planned to meet the childÂ’s needs. I think it is really destructive when inclusion fails. It is better to build up to inclusion gradually where possible.
