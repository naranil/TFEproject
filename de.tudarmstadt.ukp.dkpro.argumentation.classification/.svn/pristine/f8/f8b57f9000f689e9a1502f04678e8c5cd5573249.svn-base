I hardly think it makes you a bad person to want a better education for your kids. My sister and brother-in-law are not wealthy, but they worked hard, spent their money wisely and put three boys through private school. The results are two West Point graduates that are now an attorney and engineer and a Wake Forest graduate that is now a radiologist. Private schools are like private business, they must deliver a superior product or fold. Public schools are like most other public institutions. Dumb down to accommodate and encourage average performance.
