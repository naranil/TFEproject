We kept our middle child back one year. She turned 5 in early September, but our thought was emotionally, she wasn't ready, so she started at 6. We always did a lot of reading and exploring the world we live in, so keeping her mind busy wasn't a problem. She is now a lawyer, who graduated in 2011, president of the law school bar association, hired right out of school and doing very well. What struck me throughout her school years was her total confidence as she went through school. She always felt she could succeed and did.
