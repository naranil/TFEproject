Oh boy… oh my little (but very tall) girl. I’ve chosen to put her into a second year of preschool next year (5 days instead of 3) because I feel that’s what is right for her. She’s a late October baby, but I’m not sure she’s ready for kindergarten. But I worry. Will she be the giant of her class every year? Will there be an opportunity to skip her a grade? She’s quite bright, but socially still a little awkward. I don’t feel I’m ‘holding her back’, yet if she has brand new twin sisters arriving in July, should I totally turn her world upside down and ship her off to another school with mostly older kids? I’m torn (and totally on the fence) both ways. I want her to excel academically, but I don’t want to throw too many changes at her at once. I’m with you, Erica. I’m torn, and I chose the now unpopular ‘redshirting’, but not so she can be a hockey superstar…:) I just thought this was a better pace for her. In ten years, I’m sure the ‘experts’ will be telling me I should have held her back, because all the young kids are struggling… You can’t win.
