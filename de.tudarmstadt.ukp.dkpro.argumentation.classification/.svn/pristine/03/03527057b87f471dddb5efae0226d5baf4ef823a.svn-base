I agree. It’s time to get prayer in there. Our children are suffering. Our founding fathers were all Christian and we came here for religious freedom. It’s freedom of religion, not freedom FROM religion. There’s a lot of jews and muslims in public schools, but it will help them too. If we don’t get this country back for us we will be in trouble. We are a great country because of Jesus he helped us fight in world war II, and now the fighting is here on our front door step. I can’t believe that the supreme court took prayer out of school. We need to get a real president with real Christian values. In fact every president we have ever had was Christian. We never had a jew as a president. doesn’t that mean something? There is no such thing as separation of church and state, and let’s show the world that we’re not going to take this secularization of government any longer!
