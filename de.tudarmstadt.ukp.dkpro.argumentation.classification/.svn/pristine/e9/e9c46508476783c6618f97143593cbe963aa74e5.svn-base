But parents cannot teach anything they do not know, that means that many children will be at a serious disadvantage in the modern world because they will be without the skillset of things their parents could not teach them. It also means that many children, if not required by law to attend school, simply will not. There are far too many parents who just don't give a damn about their kids or their future. 
Sorry, you're not convincing me that your methods make any sense.
