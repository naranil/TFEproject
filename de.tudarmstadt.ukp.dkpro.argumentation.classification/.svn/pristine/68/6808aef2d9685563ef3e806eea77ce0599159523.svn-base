The public schools are doing it themselves as well.  The same argument could be made for magnet schools.  You are taking the best and brightest, along with parents who care out of their home area schools and put them in a magnet school.  This leaves the lower level students and parents who don't care left in the local area schools.   If pulling good parents out of the public neighborhood schools is bad for public schools then quit bussing the smart kids out of their home areas and leave them in the neighborhood schools.    Our obligation is to our own children first.  Even if my public school is providing a safe an excellent education (which mine is)  I should be able to send my children to a Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist, or secular private school if I believe that is in the best interest of my child.  My child is not a pawn to be used to better a system that is slow to improve.
