I didn't think so, I was clarifying just in case.
Well I have to admit, I won't be doing that! There's a running joke that I have been telling my friends...........That I own a GUN and a SHOVEL!! In all seriousness it is a very different world that our children are growing up they are being exposed to so many more things at younger ages, and the trick is to be one step ahead, whether we can achieve this is another matter. Best of luck with yours! Oh and I also own a UTE and a BLOCK of LAND!
