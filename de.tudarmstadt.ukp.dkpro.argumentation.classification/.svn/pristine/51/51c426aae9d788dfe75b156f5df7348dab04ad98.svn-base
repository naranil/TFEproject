To the author of this, so-called "Report" YOU CAN GO FLY A KITE!   Let me just say, I went to Public schools growing up. My parents couldn't afford to put me through the Private System. When I got older, I decided to go to a Private Christian college. I now manage International Business for one of the top performing companies in my industry.   For my children, no way am I sending them to Public schools. Forget it......I will homeschool them before I do that. Public schools, in my area, are a joke. And with the direction that our country is headed, I don't want idiots in public schools turning my kids into little rats with no ambition to do anything more than suck on the teet of the system and work for nothing with the drive to come home and do not more than play video games and "Connect" with their homies on facebook and Twitter. My kids are going to school to learn, and will be raised and guided at home. Public schools are gov't funded daycare. Shame that I don't have a choice WHERE to allocate my tax dollars. I have to trust liers and thieves to allocate $$ to driving our once great nation into the pooper.
