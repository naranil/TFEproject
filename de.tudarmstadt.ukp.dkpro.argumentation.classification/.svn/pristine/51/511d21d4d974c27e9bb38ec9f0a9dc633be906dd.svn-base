Also has anyone considered that maybe the reason many "redshirted" kids to not do as well academically is because their parents waited a year to start them because they did not feel they were ready and maybe they are just not academic performers. 
I'm all for redshirting kids who are not academically ready. But this holding them back because they are immature? No way - not a good reason IMO ... because they will grow up,, they will mature. Got one friend who held her kid back in K because she was immature (August birthday). Now she's in 2nd and all I hear is "she's so smart" "she's bored." "they want to put her in G&T" -- now seriously, it's not jealousy - my ODD is identified gifted and I don't brag to the world about it. It's our deal. Comes up in conversation? I don't hide it. But I don't bring it up and it's "yeah, us too, so how is your dd liking her new music teacher?" So this mom is just annoying as Hell - heck, I don't think she realizes my kid is too. I swear if I hear one more time (and I know I will) about how advanced her kid is ... I'm just going to say "so why not move her to 3rd grade where she belongs?"
