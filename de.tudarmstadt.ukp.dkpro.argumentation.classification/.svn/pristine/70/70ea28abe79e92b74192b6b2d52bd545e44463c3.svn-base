This is an oddly personal topic for me. New York was where the case was. The day before the decision the teacher called me up and I didn't know the prayer by heart: no one had told me I needed to memorize it. She made me stay until 5:30, go home and write it a thousand times and told me if I didn't know it the next day I'd stay until 7:30. This was third grade, I think. 
The New York prayer was inane: written not to offend pretty much anyone at the time. That way, IMO, it offended everyone. (Back then I kind of didn't care.) How can you write one that wouldn't be problematic? Unless we are to gut the right to religion, or lackthereof, no way. And no one should be forced to say, or listen, to any prayer. A moment of silence I have less of a problem, depending upon how it is introduced each day. 
Enforced faith, or enforced lack of it, is wrong. However, in High School, and maybe Middle: depending on how it's taught, a comparative religion course that includes how faith, and lack of it, has been part of human history 
The result of my incident is that day the decision came down that day. The next day she skipped right over it. 
I thanked God that day.
