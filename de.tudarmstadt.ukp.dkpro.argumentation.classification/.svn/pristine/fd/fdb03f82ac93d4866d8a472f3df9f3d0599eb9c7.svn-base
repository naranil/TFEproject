As a product of private school and a spouse a product of public school... we decided to try public school for our kids.  It was not a great education to say the least.  I was the PTA president for 4 years, chair of the ESSAC committee and involved in all supportive aspects.  Here's what I learned in Dade County FL. 1. there is no scaffolding learning in math.  they have loads of bench marks and your child never really masters what's important, thus it doesn't build on itself.  The best countries in Math have like 4 benchmarks... master addition, then subtraction, etc. we have like 16. 2. they teach to the test (FCAT). my son had basically no science in 5th grade because it was not on the test.  schools get rewarded for scoring high. 3. my son's gifted class had no books, just crappy copies.  the money was there, they just chose not to do it.  when I offered to buy books and called the districts, the next day the kids had books. 4. rhetoric, politics beyond a parents control. 5. too many kids in a class 6. the UNION! 7. and I can keep going on. we put our eldest in a preparatory school and have never looked back.  the teachers are so incredibly happy, well educated and are in it for the right reasons. my children absolutely love school and they don't emphasize a specific program - they put emphasis on all.  The public school system is full of money in the wrong places, it's way top heavy and spent thousands of dollars buying things they threw out without even opening.  There's a lot of hand greasing and nepotism - I'm speaking for Florida.  If you can do it, a good preparatory school is second to none.  My family could not be happier.
