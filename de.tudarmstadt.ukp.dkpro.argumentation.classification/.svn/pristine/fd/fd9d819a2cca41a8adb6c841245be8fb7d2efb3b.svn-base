I do not think that will makes much difference if your public school  is performing at your expectations. When children are small and get expose to language and questionable  behaviors you will like to protect them by sending them to a more structural environment After I think that with home support, guidance and clear communication of expectation they  should do well in any school if the public school continue performing to the higher standards
