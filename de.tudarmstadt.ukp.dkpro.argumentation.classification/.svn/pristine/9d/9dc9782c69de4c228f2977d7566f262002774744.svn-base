I went to public school and it was rated the best in California at the time.  My son went to parochial school because the school system we lived in was not good.  But since we were not Catholic he had to take a 4 hour test.  He got in and I paid $40 a month at that time it was a lot of money, 1970's.  Can you imagine what it was like to take that test at 5.  I paid taxes just like everyone else during this time.  When he went to high school I moved to Oklahoma so he could attend a public high school in the country I couldn't afford to send him to parochial high school cost to much but I knew he would get a better one on one in a small town and he did.  He went on to college finished in four years, which many don't do. I was a single parent and they give odds that single parent kids don't go to college well mine did and finished. He has a good job and a family now and is debating on sending his kids to private school.  I would do it again.  This is America we all have a chose where we want to send our kids, some public schools are great but if you can and want to send them to private why not.
