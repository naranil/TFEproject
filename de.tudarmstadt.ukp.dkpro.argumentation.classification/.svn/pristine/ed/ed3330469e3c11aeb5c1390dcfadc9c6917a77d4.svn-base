The only problem with your article is that the US Constitution DOES NOT support Christianity.
What they are doing wrong is interfering with the rights of the students WHO DO want to express their respect for The Creator as long as it does not collide with the rights of those who do not. 
Instead of an and/or situation we need a simple/basic law that will allow students to opt out of public prayer without getting in trouble so students who wish to follow can freely do so. 
The law does not have to be paragraph after paragraph long like how Atheists like to make their laws as complicated as can be. 
Also Extreme Atheists ARE banning people from being able to worship the Creator in public places like banning Christmas and taking God out of US coins. 
There are other stupid incidents but I cannot remember them all off the top of my head but in other words we are going down a dark spiritualess path. 
Right now in the entertainment industry things are either very naught with love for the self or very stupid NOT teaching you anything in a fun engaging way where you donâ€™t fully realize you are being taught something. 
I miss the fun educational video games that had adventuring as a theme.
