Oh my goodness, I have been arguing for a change in public education for several years, but I sure would not use the words you all are using. What has corrupted public education and how? 
What is the present administrative model and how would you change it?
The populace needs to be educated about what? I have been trying to educated people about education for years and this is the first time I have seen a thread about education go so far, and no on is not addressing what I believe is the most important education/social concern, so how do you propose to educate anyone about education? 
Why would anyone want to pay for education that is not doing the job right, and what is a good education?
