This writer is way off the mark...I'm a bad parent because I sent my kids to a private, Christian school?  I don't want the federal government to be responsible for teaching my children and I certainly do not want them to "indoctrinate" my children with liberal bias and anti-Christian-Judeo teachings, not to mention a revised American History, where textbooks devote chapters to Muslims and Islam and hardly anything to our Godly forefathers.  They have been pouring zillions of dollars into the public school system for years and look at it.  Parents should have the right to educate their children the way they see fit.  It isn't the governments responsibility...And btw, our forefathers were educated in mostly private schools and I think history proves how well they did!
