Unbelievable......This lady is an absolute idiot.  You cannot expect a broken system to change just like we cannot expect the government to live within a budget.  This was shown in the last election when the makers were outnumbered by the takers.  We live in an entitlement society at present perpetuated by our current administration.  The change we are making by pulling our kids out of public schools is exactly the message that needs to get sent.  To whomever wrote this stupid article.....Better to be silent and thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.  You have just succeeded in the latter....... congratulations.
