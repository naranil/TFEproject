Ajmagain You got there first with the comment I would have made. The expectation level at my school was shocking, both from pupils and staff. 
My sister consistently got top marks, despite being off school a lot with a medical condition which necessitated lots of operations and studying at home. At a meeting with the "guidance" teacher when asked what she wanted to do, she said to be a scientist. She was told that she was being too optimistic and she should try to be a nurse instead. Grrrr... 
Well she is now a scientist with degree, MSC, PHD etc... If this was the encouragement the most able pupils were getting I dread to think about the rest.
