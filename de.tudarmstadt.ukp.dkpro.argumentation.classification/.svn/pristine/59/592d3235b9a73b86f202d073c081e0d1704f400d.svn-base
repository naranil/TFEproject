My wife and I also wanted our daughter to receive an education in Christ and that's a big reason we sent her to Christian private school.  Public schools have kicked prayer and Christ out and now their working on the pledge of allegiance.  Whatâ€™s next?  Really I'm bad because I want my daughter to know Christ.
