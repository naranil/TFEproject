I decided when my middle child was pushed to skip thru school to hold him back. He didn't want to skip and didn't posses the required social skills. Each child is different, I had to find other outlets for his intelect but it was very important that this undersized uncoordinated boy learn the proper social skills before he was pushed into higher grades. He was 6 years old when he started 1st grade. The school only stopped trying to skip him to an older grade when in 8th grade they introduced excellerated classes. These worked out very well he was able to compete with older boys in the math/sciences but stay with his grade for english/history and recess.
