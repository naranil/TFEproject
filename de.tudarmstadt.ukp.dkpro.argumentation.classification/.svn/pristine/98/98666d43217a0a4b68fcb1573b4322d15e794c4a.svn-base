The drift toward private schools was predicted as far back at the mid 1980s when I first became a teacher. It was said that a 'voucher system' would eventually be put in place, where by the funding attached to each student would 'travel' with the student. This meant that the public school funding would be dependent upon demand from the community. As a publicly educated teacher I was concerned about the genesis of 'schools of last resort'. Later, as a parent, I changed direction and became worried about the behaviour that impeded learning and teaching in public schools- behaviour that I witnessed first hand. Consequently I chose to move my own children from public to private. I own up to being part of the problem of the weakening of the public system. I couldn't abide that my own values of respect, cooperation and high expectations were not being held for my children in the public system. The teachers in both systems are the same, but the expectations of the parents are simply different. I want for my children what my parents did not have to pay for!
