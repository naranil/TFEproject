My kids went to public school, took AP classes (college courses) and both graduated in the top 10% of their class. My son went on to get his engineering degree. He said he never learned how to 'study' until he took a summer course that moved so fast, the teacher couldn't hit all the high spots. My daughters business English prof suggested that she simply come back and take the final...she said she'd paid for his time and she'd be in each and every class. 
I don't equate high grades with being 'taught' necessarily, sometimes the student simply hasn't been challenged yet. 
Once a student is in high school, I'm not sure the parent should be there to make sure all the problems are taken care of. Maybe that is why so many college freshmen feel like 'fish out of water'. (For the student without emotional, physical or learning disabilities.)
