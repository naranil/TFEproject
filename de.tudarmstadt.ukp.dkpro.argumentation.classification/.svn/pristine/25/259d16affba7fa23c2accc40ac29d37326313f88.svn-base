Prayer being removed from school is just the leading indicator of a nation that is ‘Falling Away’ from Jehovah. It is just another sign of moral/spiritual decay of the American. And the disasters we see today are simply God’s finger writing on the wall: Mene, mene, Tekel, Upharsin; that is, God has weighed America in the balances, and we’ve been found wanting. No wonder 50 million babies have been aborted since 1973. No wonder hundreds of earthquakes have popped up in ‘divers places’. No wonder Hurricane Katrina smote New Orleans just before a gay rally! No wonder our economy is nose-diving! THink About it! God’s speaking to us. We can ignore Him or listen to Him. Just know He will judge the wicked. Whew! I’m ready.
