Hi Guys I need to chose a high school for my daughters and my question is, is it better to send gilrs to an all girls school or a co-ed environment. Both schools are great public schools with excellent reputations,(Balwyn & Canterbury Girls) we are spoilt in that way but I want to make the best decision. Your opinions would be appreciated. Cheers Mr C
