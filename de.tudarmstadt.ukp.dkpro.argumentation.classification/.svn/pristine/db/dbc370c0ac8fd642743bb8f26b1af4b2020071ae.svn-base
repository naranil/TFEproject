I think there will be a backlash about this.
I have a child who I sent to KG at age 4, our cutoffs are December 1. She was fine, she's in 2nd now and fine and every few months the difference between her and her peers gets smaller and smaller and smaller. Until Poof! its gone. 
I don't think they should allow it personally in public school unless a child is tested delayed. That's my personal opinion.
