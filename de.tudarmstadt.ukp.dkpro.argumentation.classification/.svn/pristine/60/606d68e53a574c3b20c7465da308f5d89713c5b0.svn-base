(Seriously CBC, why does it take 3 hours to get a comment posted): ANYWAY, Here we go again. We are getting to a place in this country where political correctness is trumping almost everything else. When does it end? Are we supposed to grant exceptions to everyone claiming to be part of a religious group? If so then people better start brushing up on their knowledge of less widely practiced religions, such as Wicca, Shinto, Satanism, Kabbalah, Bahai'i, etc. And what happens when one practice interferes with another practice's beliefs. If my memory serves me correctly, there has been plenty of controversy over reciting the Lord's Prayer in schools, yet this special status has been given to Muslim students, in this case. I find it simply offensive that Christianity is seen as some sort of imperialistic oppressive practice even when the majority of the students in the class are Christian, because it makes students of other faiths' uncomfortable, yet any other religion cries racism when the situation is reversed. Here's a suggestion: why don't we all stop pretending that Canada is this utopian place where everyone holds hands and sings about buying the world a coke in their own language. Why don't students that have a particularly strong religious faith go to schools that are especially for them (e.g. Muslims go to Muslim schools, Christians to Christian schools, Jewish to Jewish schools etc.), and for all other students, no religious doctrine in the schools, period.
