I went to a private school K-5th grade and was enrolled in public school starting in the 6th grade. I tested at the 9th grade level when I went into our public schools in 6th grade. Yes private schools give you a better education. However, my social skills were seriously lacking from being in a small private school. Public school was by far the best thing my parents did for me in that regard. The "everyday" social skills I learned in public school were worth just as much as my private school education in my mind. I dont think I would have been the person I am today with out a mix of both.
