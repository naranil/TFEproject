What is needed is full support of the public school system nationwide. In all states, not just a handful. Then politicians could see that they will not get away will cutting funding or creating rules that makes it unfair in anyway or any parent to have their child educated exactly how they want. Now, I'm not necessarily advocating for the national government to take over regulating state boards of education, not at all. I'm advocating for all citizens with kids who want to see the system thrive to actually take a stand and not just say, "meh, I like my particular circumstances, so I think things are fine." 
But the thing is that most of us aren't just sitting around doing nothing to help the system which we are backing out of. I've gone to plenty of rallies in both Philly and Harrisburg to protest budget cuts, and to rally against things like the absurd amounts of standardized testing that schools now require. My neighbors that have been forced to put their child in private school this year do the same, most all of the homeschoolers that I know do the same. I'm involved within my community, helping to support our public schools. I plan to volunteer at the elementary school once DD is a bit older. Just because we're trying to provide something different for our children does not mean that we're simply giving up, or rejecting public schools all together. They just aren't working right now, and I will not allow my child to suffer waiting for the entire system to be repaired.
