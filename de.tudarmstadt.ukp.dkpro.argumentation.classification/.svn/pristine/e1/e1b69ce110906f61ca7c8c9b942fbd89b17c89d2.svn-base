My three children went to private grammar schools and two of them went to private high schools, one to public high school. All three of them participated in sports programs, were challenged academically, etc., etc. My two daughters went on to excellent colleges; my son did not go to college...and all three of them have fantastic careers, earning very decent livings. Would I change a thing?  Not on your life.
