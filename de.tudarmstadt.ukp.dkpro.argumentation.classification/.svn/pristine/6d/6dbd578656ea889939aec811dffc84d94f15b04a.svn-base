Okay, if I had children now they would go to private school.  I am a police officer and work part time at a private school and the attitude there is totally different. The kids there are very respectful and so far no one asked about my gun.   If I go into a public school they ask about your gun and half the time while we are there, we are arresting someone.  I encourage everybody I know to send their children to private school.
