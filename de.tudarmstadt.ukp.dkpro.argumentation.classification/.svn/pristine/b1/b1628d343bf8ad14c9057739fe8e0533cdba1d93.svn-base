I am a mother of four my oldest is 21 and the youngest is 10. I have seen a huge shift in people holding kids back. I truly think it is dependent on your child. My youngest has a severe learning disability we sent him to kindergarten thinking he would catch up. His teacher recommended we repeat kindergarten which we did. Listen to your pre school teacher and trust your gut.
