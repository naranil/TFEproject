I have been a long term defender of public education - although fortunately have the advantage of living in a higher SES area where the public schools are relatively well resourced. Made the decision this year to move eldest child out of the public system and into a Catholic private school as really felt that the large public high school didn't have its eye on the ball when it came to student welfare, particularly in relation to bullying between the boys and self harming and worrying attitudes to eating amongst the girls. Also, while academic standards were high, it was very much a 'survival of the fittest' type attitude which posed challenges for our bright but sensitive daughter. We are finding the Catholic school much kinder and more supportive on the whole and also, surprisingly, stronger on things like social justice and inclusion of students with disabilities and that type of thing.
