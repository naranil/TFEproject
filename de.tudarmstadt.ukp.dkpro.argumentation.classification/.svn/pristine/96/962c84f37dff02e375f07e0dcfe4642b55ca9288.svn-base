my granddaughter just graduated from public school with a 4. grade average. she asked me what time it was once and I "quarter after two" she had no idea what that meant. she thinks 26% for a credit card is a good deal, and had no idea what nuclear energy is  she has no idea of how the federal government works or even whos in it. ask her where electricity comes from and she points to the wall. shes not stupid shes just not educated if I had the money I would have sent her to a private school in a heartbeat
