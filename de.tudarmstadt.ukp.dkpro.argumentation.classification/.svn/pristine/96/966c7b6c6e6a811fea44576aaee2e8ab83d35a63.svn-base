I think there is a huge different between separate classes for boys and girls where boys and girls are taught differently based on stereotypes about how boys and girls learn, and single sex schools. I think single sex schools -- where all the leadership positions will be filled girls, and all the math and science stars will be girls -- can be highly beneficial for girls.
