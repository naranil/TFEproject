*There are equal qualifications, that's the point. I'm also not taking any resources from other students, because if my child plays sports then I will be paying for them to do so, just like every other parent.* 
I'm done discussing something that I already provided cites for. What you're saying is inaccurate. It has been inaccurate, and it will remain inaccurate. Further, I addressed the qustion broadly, and if for some reason your statement were accurte (which it isn't), it would still not be accurate across the entirety of the system. *Once again, for the third or fourth time, should my child not be allowed to supplement with only one or two public school classes, or does this pertain just to sports?* 
The only difference I see between those two is the qualification piece -- but if the funding situation remains the same, then no, your child should not be able to attend. *Either way, I fundamentally believe in equality for every single child. That will never change.* 
Equality for your child entails your child choosing to attend, or not, public school -- a process by which funding for your child's presence is provided to the school in order to provide the resources that presence entails. It does not entail your child unequally taking resources from enrolled children without equal qualification and compensation for the school.
