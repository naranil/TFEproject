hi.i am a 35year old lady who would love to see prayer back in the schools. i am writing a paper for my college writing class about the situation. only God himself can turn this world around and i believe He is tired of all the corruption caused by man. He is soon to return so we all need to be ready when He comes. prayer should be done openly and privately. please lets get prayer back in the schools to eliminate all the violence. invite the Lord in and watch the transformation.
