As a student, i think schools should definately support prayer in schools . No amount of teachers and staff can keep students from throwing up a prayer before class or a test or before they eat lunch. As far as a moment of silence during homeroom, I say why not?. Children who don't want to pray don't have to, and those who do can have their concentration to do so. A moment of silence doesnt require students or teachers to pray; Prayer isnt even mentioned in the words, so why make a big deal of it?. I fully understand nonbelievers or nonreligious people who dont pray, but their moment of silence can be used for relaxation or even sleep if they want.
