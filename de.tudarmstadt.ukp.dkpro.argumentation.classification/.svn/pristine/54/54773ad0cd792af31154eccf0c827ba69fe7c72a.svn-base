As soon as the public education system brings back religion and disipline in the schools more parents will reconsider putting their children back in public schools. Until then I want my children in a safe religious setting where teachers can actually teach and not just babysit. The kids know that the teachers are no longer in control and they can pretty much do as they please.The teachers are seldom able to do what they were trained to do which is to teach. Solution #1- Make parents realize that it is their responsibility to teach their children respect and disipline. It is not the school systems job. Their job is to teach.   Solution #2- Bring back spanking and other forms of disipline with parental permission. Until students realize that they have to be responsible for their actions , it is unlikely that the environment will improve.   Solution #3- Bring back religious freedom in all schools. Our country was foundeed on this principle but it was removed because a small percentage of the American people objected. If we could have a national vote on religion in schools, there is no doubt that a large majority would vote to bring religion back into the schools.   Solution #4- Consider teaching ROTC in more  junior and high schools for both boys and girls. This will teach them additional dicipline, pride, and respect as they grow into adulthood. Solution #5- Limit the power that the teachers unions have over their members as it relates to voting practices. Vote for what is good for the students and not feel oblgated to vote a certain way just becuase the unions say so.
