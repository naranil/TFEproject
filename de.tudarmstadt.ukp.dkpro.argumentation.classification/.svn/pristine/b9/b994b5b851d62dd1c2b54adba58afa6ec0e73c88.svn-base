Typical liberal media article on the "rich" vs public education.  Start the article by stating that the wealthy should INVEST IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS...really, I assume they pay their property taxes (more dollars of them than most, in fact) just like the other property owners.  If the writer means "invest your time and talent; become involved" in your public school system, then my answer is that every time I have attended a school board meeting, it is patently obvious that they want no questioning or suggestions from the parents.  I could go on for pages, but I will end by saying that I hurt them (my public school system) in the worst way I could.....I home schooled all four of our kids.
