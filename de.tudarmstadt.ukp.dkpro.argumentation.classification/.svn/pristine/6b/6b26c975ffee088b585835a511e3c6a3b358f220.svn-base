In a perfect world, everyone would send their kids to a public school and make it the best system possible. The question to ask will one person/parent make a difference? What parent out there who really cares for their child wants to take that chance? I started out an idealist who thought by my community involvement I could make a better world for my kids The social acceptance of greed in the 1980's and the immediate gratification needs of our society today make us ask if we will still have a world tomorrow - much less a better world tomorrow. Now that I have grandchildren I am glad my kids send their kids to private schools.
