Interesting question - Just the other week we went to a Home Ed camp for the 1st time. It was fun. The children put on shows; from the youngest doing quick caberet acts to the teens playing in bands and DJing at the discos each night. 
Oh, and they had two separate sports days for older and younger children.
Not all home ed families are into camping, but I think that a fair number of local groups also organise things like that too.
