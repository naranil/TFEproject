I could teach my children History, probably better than some educators, but my children all attended public school and my wife and I , both teachers with Master Degrees, supplemented their education with parental involvement and oversight. All went on to college and beyond. 
Part of education is social interaction, no parent can fill that gap , nor can any parent be the best teacher, they are mere fools.
