You mean when most children weren't educated at all, they just worked on their parent's farm and a large percentage never learned to read or write? Let's face facts, if we did away with public education, most private schools are religious these days, that's where people would have to turn. As much as I hate a lot of things that happen in public education, give me that stupidity over the utter lunacy of teaching kids about invisible father figures in the sky. Of course, then they could learn about the earth being flat and that big flood too.
