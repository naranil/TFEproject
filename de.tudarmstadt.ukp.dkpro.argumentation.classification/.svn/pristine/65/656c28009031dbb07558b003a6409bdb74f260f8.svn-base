This is absolutely the worst piece of garbage I have ever read!  We did without so we could send our kids to Catholic school.  I helped paint classrooms and wash windows.  My husband helped update plumbing.  Other parents did landscaping, waxed floors, supervised recess, helped in the kitchen,  repaired the furnace and water heater, maintained the school bus, and re-sealed the driveway.  This is the way it has always been done in the Catholic school system.  On top of all this, we also paid taxes to the public school.  If public school parents don't like their 'crappy' school then let THEM make changes.  We have done our share.
