But you are free to carry a Bible until you use it to violate the rights of others.
Well, of course the whole Bible isn't mythology. There is some religious laws, there is a lot of poetry, there is some history, and there is a lot of mythology. How else should Genesis be characterized? 
Nonsense. As an agent of the government you would be enjoined from giving the appearance that the government endorsed or supported a particular religion. I believe that there has been case law on the matter in which a teacher was dismissed for putting a Bible on the desk. Carry it in your brief case, but to take it out and place it promenently on the desk every day crosses the line. 
It depends on what you think a Christian is. There are too many who try to use the government and our schools to force their religion on everyone. I would have thought that a Christian would respect the rights of others, especially the rights of children. 
The teach in a private school or don't teach. You know the rules, so if you take a job that makes you an agent of government, you need to respect the Constitution. Carry your Bible and pray if you want, but do it privately. 
But much of it is mythology.
Then you can continue to worship your silly book. All this time I thought it was God who was supposed to be worshiped. Not so with Bible thumping literalists.
