I think you really have to know your own child. He sounds like he’s mostly ready, but like you said he would be one of the youngest in his class. I know my oldest was and it’s just now in the fourth grade that he’s really catching up to his peers. He wasn’t ready for kindergarten though. You son sounds like he’s much more ready intelligence wise but not emotionally wise. 
With this in mind I feel it does no harm to wait till he’s six. It’s amazing how much more emotionally mature a six year old is.
