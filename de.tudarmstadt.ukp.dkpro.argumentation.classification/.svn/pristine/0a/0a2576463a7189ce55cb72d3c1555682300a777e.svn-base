Let’s not blame the lack of prayer in school against the late Madeleine O’hare. She and all of her followers (atheist/agnostics) are still in the minority – there are a lot more Christians (or at least a lot more claiming to be). And when I was in school no one stopped me from praying when I wanted to pray. If all the Christians in America decided to stop at 10:00 AM on Thursday and joined in a collective prayer – who’s going to stop them? How bad do we want to pray in school – that’s the question? 
How bad did Daniel in the Bible want to pray? Bad enough that he was willing to put his life on the line. How many Christians “really” want prayer in school? How many are willing to go to prison for standing up? And if they put all the Christians in prison for praying – then who will pay the taxes to support the prisons? 
Rosa Parks did not want to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery public bus one day – and was willing to go to jail to support her principles. 
Christians need to stop complaining and acting like victims of the “system.” We are victors – not victims. And I can pray anytime I please – anywhere I please – and no one can stop me. They can kill me, they can put me in jail – but they can’t stop me from praying – in the school, on the bus, at the store or in the football stadium. 
The government or O’Hare or no one else took prayer out of the school. Christians just simply stopped praying – period! 
Christians, stop blaming the government and the atheist for taking prayer out of the schools. Fact: if you’re a “person of prayer” – then no one can stop you from praying unless you give them permission to do so.
