Very poor logic.  Are we to conclude that only the parents of children who attend private school care about the schools?  Why can't the parents of children who do attend public schools change the system? I will tell you why, because the Federal Government has completely muddled up what local communities can and can't do to improve their public schools.  They may provide money, but they also dictate how that money and locally raised money is spent.  On top of everything else, parents who send their children to private schools, at least where I live, do support the public school system through paying taxes.
