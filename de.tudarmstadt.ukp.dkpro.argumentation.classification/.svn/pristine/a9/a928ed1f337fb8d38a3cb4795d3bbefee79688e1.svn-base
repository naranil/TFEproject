So what you are saying is that the problem with the school system in the United States is the parents of the children who attend the schools?  Your thinking is mind boggling.  The problem with the public schools is who is running them and how they have been run.  Adding caring parents is not going to change who runs the school and how they are run.  Mark it down.  Therefore, your suggested efforts will not fix anything.  But then all the fine people who send their children to private schools will be equally burdened with the pain and suffering of the public school system.  You will be happy then right?
