Listen, you can’t soley blame depleting morals based on the removal of God from schools. If one truely believed in God or wanted to, there’s always Church to go to. The U.S. Government cannot inforce or support the church and it’s ways. I have no set religion for I am unsure which is the right one for me. I believe that morals is a family constructed issue. You cannot blame the school for bad morals, blame the household in which the students derive from. If anythinf, there’s still private school out there to send our kids. But I’m still saying, morals is a family touched and tought issue, not the school.
