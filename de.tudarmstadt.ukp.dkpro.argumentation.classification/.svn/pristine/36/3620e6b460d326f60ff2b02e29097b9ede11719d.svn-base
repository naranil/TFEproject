Don't need statistics, just need to put your kids into the public school system to know they're being disadvantaged through under resourcing and teachers ill-equipped to deal with the policies they are meant to be managing, i.e. bullying, attire, social attitude, etc. 
The number of parents pulling their kids from the public system speaks for itself in how the public system is operating. 
Pulling my kids out of the public system was the best thing we ever did for them!
Out in the Western suburbs, where we can afford to live, public high schools just won't do unless you're happy for your kids to be beaten up, spat on, thrown rocks at, and depressed going to a school full of delinquents who swear at teachers & disrupt the class all day. How can they learn and grow in such a place, even with high involvement and support from home? 
We tried it. Pulled one of our kids out of a private school into the local public school. An outgoing & popular bright teenager transformed into one hiding in closets to avoid school. Pulled him out again and put him in a selective school and he's loving it. 
Unfortunately, for parents who cannot afford private education, live in certain suburbs or who want to send their children to a public school, the selective system is the only one that will nurture and encourage them to learn and grow amongst peers who want to learn. Parents should not be judged for trying to do what's best for their children. Agree with Moore that our children are not to be sacrificed for a utopian ideal that is just not going to happen any time soon.
