Lambage, NO I don't think you have a right to know what my child is learning. If she chooses medicine as a career and qualifies as a doctor then you can be pretty confident that she will have the skills and knowledge necessary for that job. You don't need to know what periods of British history she studied, what books she read. It won't effect you if she read any Shakespeare or not. It really is none of your business and none of the state's business. 
Yes, if she is lucky enough to qualify with you teaching her, unfortunate if she had a parent that couldn't give a damn. 
But you agree that certain levels and standards have to be reached in order for her to become a doctor? Set by a group of professionals? 
It is of course our business because what your child learns, who your child becomes directly effects everyone else in society.
