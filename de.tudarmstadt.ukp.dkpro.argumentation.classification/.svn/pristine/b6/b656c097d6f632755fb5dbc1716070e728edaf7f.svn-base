She was offered teaching fellowships from both departments and went on to get a her graduate in French. She is a genius and is knowledgeable in the arts and in the sciences. Her mother, my sister, has a masters in mathematics. She was in charge of all math programs, k through 12, for nationally recognized public schools in a surburban D.C. county. My sister schools all her grandchilden in higher mathematics. My niece's first born scored very high on the SAT's and is a second year student in engineering at a Florida school. She is on a scholarship I do not support home schooling, but for my niece and her children, it is working very good. I am a college professor.
