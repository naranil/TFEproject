The writer is an idiot. As a responsible, rational, moral human being, I have a hierarchy of responsibility. I have a responsibility to my society but I also have a responsibility to my family. My responsibility to my family trumps my responsibility to society. This is why I work to support my family rather than work to support a random group of my fellow human beings. Ergo, if I have kids that I love and I live in a place with a crappy school district, you're damn right I'm going to put them in a private school if I'm able to do it. I'm not going to ship them off to some crappy public just so I can use them as a tool for making a sociopolitical point.
