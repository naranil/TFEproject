CRAP!!!  If you can afford to send your kids to  a good private school, by all means do so. "Education Experts" have pretty much ruined the Public School System, so if you can avoid it you should. The sad truth is...   Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. And those incapable of teaching become "Education Experts".
