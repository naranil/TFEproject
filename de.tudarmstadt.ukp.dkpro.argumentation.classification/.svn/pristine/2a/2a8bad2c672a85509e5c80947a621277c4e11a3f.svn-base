America is all about freedom of choice, right? I think its the parents choice to  send their kid to whatever school they feel their child will greatly benefit. Beside I think the parent are the first provider of what their child is learning and how by the way they are taught at home. This put all and I mean all parents in the driver seat to make sure their child or children are given the type of education they desired. I think that we should work to see that College education isn't a run away expensive school so anyone who wants to go to college can effort it. That the part the writer should be concern about. I think we are very lucky to the type of education that is offer here in America and the choice are endlessly so whether its private, public or other type of school we have much to offer our children. Enjoy learning with your child.
