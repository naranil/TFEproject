The law in Virginia turns Pap Finn loose to keep his son ignorant and uneducated. Here's what Pap Finn said about Huckleberry learning to read and write: 
"You're educated, too, they say—can read and write. You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he can't? I'LL take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey?—who told you you could?" 
Well no one in Virginia would step in and get Huck to school. That would violate Pap Finn's religious freedom.
