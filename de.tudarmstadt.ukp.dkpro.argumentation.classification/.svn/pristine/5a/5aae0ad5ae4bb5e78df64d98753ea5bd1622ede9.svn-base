It's wrong to send your kids to public school! YOU have no control over what's taught to them, and you have no clue what's going on there. I would NEVER send my kids to public school. NEVER. Home Schools have done such a fabulous job of actually teaching kids, and the parents are INVOLVED. Key word there, INVOLVED. Home school rocks, and public school is just another way for the government to influence your child. DON'T DO IT!!!!!
