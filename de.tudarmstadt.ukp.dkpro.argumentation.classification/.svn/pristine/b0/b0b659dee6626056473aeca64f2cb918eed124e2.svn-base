I still want to homeschool. I can make subjects come alive in a way that simply isn't possible within the physical confines of a classroom, regardless of how great the teachers or curriculum are. 
I really dislike the amount of time wasted in school.
I really, really dislike the emphasis on conformity, which happens regardless of curriculum.
And with the emphasis on standardized testing and focus on the scoring of regurgitated information, I'm not sure a curriculum I would like exists even hypothetically.
