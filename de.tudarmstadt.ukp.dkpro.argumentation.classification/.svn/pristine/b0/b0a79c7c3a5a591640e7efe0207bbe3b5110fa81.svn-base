I send my granddaughter to private school and I am far from rich. In fact my husband lost his job last April and has been unable to find a job. We struggle to pay for the education but we are not going to send her to public schools to be taught revisionist history and have a lack of morals and values. We are forced to pay for the failed public schools and then pay additionally to have her educated in the way WE want since we are her guardians. We will not settle.
