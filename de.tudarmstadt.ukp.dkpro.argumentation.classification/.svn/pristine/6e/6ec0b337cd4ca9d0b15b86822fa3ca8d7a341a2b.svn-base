Heavens! What could possibly be worse that IDEOLOGICAL REASONS!!! ;-)
I knew someone who once gave money to charity purely for ideological reasons. It was quite shocking. I've even known some freaks who refused to eat meat, simply because of ideology. 
If only people did things purely out of a mechanistic assessment of probable beneficial outcomes, where 'benefit' is a universally accepted set of criteria agreed by all of society.
