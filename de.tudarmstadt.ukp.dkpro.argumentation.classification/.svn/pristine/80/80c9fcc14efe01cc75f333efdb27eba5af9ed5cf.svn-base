Those enrolled in private schools still support public schools thru RET's like every other property owner. Public schools want a monopoly. For years they nearly had one, the result, the sad shape of our public school system. Unions DO NOT like competition (try walking across a strike line, you SCAB). The problem is without competition, the product becomes stale and innovation disappears. It's human nature. Unions and their inherent lack of competition is what is wrong with our schools, government and anything else unions monopolize. Human nature makes the final result, of anything having a lack of competition and guaranteed employment, stagnation for the simple lack of incentive.
