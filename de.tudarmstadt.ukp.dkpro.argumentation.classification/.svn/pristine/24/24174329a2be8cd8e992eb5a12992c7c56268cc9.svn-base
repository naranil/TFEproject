I'm not a fan of the nanny state, but I can see why the government is doing this. The trouble is, home schooling can be a cover for all sorts of undesirable stuff. Is the government supposed to say, OK, we just abandon home-educated kids to the whims of their parents? 
I know one "home-educated" kid. His mum doesn't send him to school because she worries he'll get bullied. Actually he's much bigger than most kids so it seems unlikely. As far as I can tell, the education he receives at home is pretty minimal - nothing like what you'd get in school. I think it's a desperate shame - the poor kid is being deprived of an education and the opportunity to mix with other children.
