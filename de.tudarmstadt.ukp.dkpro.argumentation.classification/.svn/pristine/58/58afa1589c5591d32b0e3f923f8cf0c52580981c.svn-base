Actually, there is very little a parent can personally do to change or improve a school. Can we hire or fire teachers? Can we set the curriculum? Private schools are businesses and the parents and their children are their customers. Like any business that has competition, you are going to try to offer the best to attract more customers. My son has Aspergers Syndrom and if I could afford a private school for him that would cater to his needs; you bet I'd ditch the public school system. In a heartbeat.
