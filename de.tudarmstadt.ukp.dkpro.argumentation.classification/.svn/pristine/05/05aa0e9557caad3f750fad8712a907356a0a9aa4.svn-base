How is it possible for someone with an idea this moronic to actually have an article printed on a major news site.   It is the liberal mindset that there is no right or wrong, that students cannot be disciplined in school and that teachers who perform badly cannot be fired that has destroyed the public education system in the first place.  To write an article that states that parents wanting their children to get a good education and are willing to sacrifice to pay for it are bad is absolutely ridiculous.  I have 5 children that all go to private school.  I don't own a car that has less than 190,000 miles on it.  I don't go on vacations.   I don't have a 50" TV and my mortgage payment was decided by what I can afford not by what the bank would lend me.   I have neighbors with pools in their yard driving Mercedes who go on cruises twice a year tell me they can't afford private school for their Kids.  Its a priority choice.  For me the education for my children is more important than the new car. The idea that I should sacrifice the education for my kids for the greater good of society as stated in the article is liberal (socialist) bunk. The fact that the article was printed at all shows the leanings of the media as a whole.
