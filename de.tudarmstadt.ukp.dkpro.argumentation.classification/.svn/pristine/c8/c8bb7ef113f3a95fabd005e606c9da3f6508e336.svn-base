Writers have a responsibility to be unbiased.  Public school has shortened hours and the school year in Orange County CA.   I send my son to a Catholic School and last year I saw what they were doing. Far better than when I was at that grade and far better than the local public school.    This writer is not thinking.   We all want our children to get a good education.
