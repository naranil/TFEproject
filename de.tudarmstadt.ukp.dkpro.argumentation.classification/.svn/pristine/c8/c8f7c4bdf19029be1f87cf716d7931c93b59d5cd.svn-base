My 10 year old is in a private school. This will be her second year. In public school she was the only Caucasian kid in her class in third grade. And she always said the Mexican kids was really mean to her. This was a small town in Texas. No more will she ever go to a public school again. I'm not having third grade kids profile my daughter because she's not Mexican. Every school function I went to most all the parents couldn't speak English and the kids would act like they was a little gang member or something. NO! Not having it......    So you can judge and tell me I'm wrong, but my kid is making way better grades then she was when she was in public schools. I know it sounds wrong, but that's the way it is...
