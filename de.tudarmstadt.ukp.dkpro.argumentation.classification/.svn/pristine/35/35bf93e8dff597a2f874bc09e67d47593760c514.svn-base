Knowledge of self is the greatest education any parent can give their child, Home should stand as the best learning institution for your children it begins there first, people should never totally rely on public or private schools to educate their children alone, an old phrase is that it takes a village to raise a child, I think public and private schools are useful some more than the other yet parents are the lead guidance for their offspring, what better give can a father give his sun than the understanding of the heavens above, I didn't learn that in school.
