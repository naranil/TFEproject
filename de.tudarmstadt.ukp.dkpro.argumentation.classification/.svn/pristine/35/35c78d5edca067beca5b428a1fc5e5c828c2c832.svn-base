I think it all depends on the childs individual development and personality. I am having the opposite with my youngest, he misses the cut of by 9days but I know will be ready. He will be 3 in July and will be going into the pre-school class at day care then because he is physically, emotionally and intelectually up to this level. So I am currently trying to get him assessed by the state board of education to enter pre-prep (kindergarten in USA) at school for next year. However with my oldest if he were born a couple of months earlier I would have kept him back a year as he would not have been ready.
