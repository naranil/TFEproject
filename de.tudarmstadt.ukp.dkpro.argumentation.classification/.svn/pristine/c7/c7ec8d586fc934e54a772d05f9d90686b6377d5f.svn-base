Not all public schools suck, but most do. Some teachers need to be fired, some retired, and some need to change vocations. Some teachers get tenured and then stop trying to educate since they are now "retirement safe" this prevents a lot of the new graduates from obtaining a teaching carrier and replacing the dead wood. Certain schools by us have opened the doors to ESL, and now every lowlife transfers to the great school and destroys the curriculum at that school. For that under privileged family it's a blessing, but for my family it was sad. The solution should have been fix the shxt school rather then wreck the good one. *** The real solution to improve the education system is, give every family with kids a voucher. The voucher can be surrendered at both private and public school. At public it's payment in full at private it's payment in full or pay the difference. With the voucher system in place public schools will forced to compete for the same money, hence public school will be forced to improve the way they preform! Not to mention do you really think anyone wants to pay taxes for the public system and pay huge $ for the private education. It's just like everything else the government has involvement with, failure!!
