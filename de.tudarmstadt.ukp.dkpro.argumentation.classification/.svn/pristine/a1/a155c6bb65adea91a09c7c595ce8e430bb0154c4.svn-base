People who send their children to a private school are not “bad” people. They want the best for their kids! I have worked for a group that goes into the school systems to talk to the kids. The children in the private system, are polite, listen to what you are telling them and responsive. Why, because their parents pay for them to be there. They have something to lose if they act a fool. The children in the public system, some, not all, are just waiting to get out at the end of the day. The parents think of school as a free baby sitter. I have had parents tell me, I gave birth, my job is over, it is your (mine, the teachers, ect) to raise and educate these kids. It stems from children having kids, forcing them off on the grandparents, and the children thinking that they mother is there sister. In six years of going into schools to talk to children, I have only been hit once. A fourth grader in the public system punched me in the back. He got sent to the office, and was out in 10 minutes, as he walked by me he smiled and said, “I knew I could get away with punching an adult”. They did nothing to him, just said “Do not do that”. The school systems cannot afford to suspend or expel children. They have to keep the numbers up, to keep the funds rolling in. The private schools that I have visited have a form that they want the parent’s sign, that the children can be disciplined. I have seen a few schools that if the form is not signed, they tell you that there school might not be right for you. This is because they want the children to know, there is a price for acting up. I have seen in the public system, where a principal would give candy to the children that act up, to not do it again. This fool was reinforcing bad behavior. This is the caliber of people we have in some schools in the public system. I have a three year old, and if I have to take a second or third job, she will be going to a private school.
