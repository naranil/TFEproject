SO IF YOUR SYSTEM IS MARGINAL AT BEST AND FAILING AT WORST --THE SENDING OF YOUR KID TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL IS CHILD ABUSE. WHY WOULD ANY WANT THEIR NOT TO GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS -EVEN AS THEY PAY THE DOUBLE COST [ THEY STILL PAY TAXES THAT SUPPORT THE PUBLICS ] --SEEMS LIKE THES PROGRESSIVE LIBS WOULD WANT AS MANY AS POSSIBLE TO GO PRIVATE FROM THAT STANCE ALONE. THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT THE TEACHERS AREN'T ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOBS AS THEY CAN. TOO MANY UNION RULES AND CORRUPT OFFICIALS WITH THE TOO MANY REGS .  BENEDICK IS ONE OF THOSE THAT CAN'T STAND COMPETION AND THE FACT THAT PRIVATE SCHOOL PREPARE THE KIDS FAR BETTER THAN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AT A FAR LESS COST [ NO EXORBITANT HEALTHCARE OR PENSION BENEFITS AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE ].  SHE MUST COME FROM THE TEACHERS DON'T HAVE TO ANY NOR DO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO EARN THE MONEY THEY THIEVE FROM THE TAXES --IN OTHER WORDS SHE THINKS WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT ANY FROM THE TEACHERS IF THIS IS THE CASE LETS DO AWAY WITH ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SAVE THE MONEY AND AGGRAVATION OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH CORRUPT UNIONS AND THE OFFICIALS THEY PUT IN OFFICE THAT GRANTED THEM THEIR GOLDEN PARACHUTE JOBS. MONEY HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER NOT TO BE THE SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE OF A QUALITY EDUCATION. WHAT EVER THIS AUTHOR IS DOING IF JUDGING BY THIS SHE IS INCOMPETENT AND SHOULD BE FIRED.
