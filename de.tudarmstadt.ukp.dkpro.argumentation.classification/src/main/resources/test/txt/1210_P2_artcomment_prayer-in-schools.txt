True rights are given to men by God and are inalienable because no man has the authority to deny, transfer or take away what God has given. 
The nature of rights is a function of one's own authority, not someone else's. Authority to a "right" is exclusively given by God or voluntarily conferred. A person may, by choice forfeit or waive an inalienable right but a person can not waive the inalienable rights of another. 
Civil governments are granted powers but no inalienable rights. The people can give some of their powers to government, but they can never give away their rights. 
The only purpose of civil government is to protect the inalienable rights of non-civil institutions and those of the individual. (e.g. right to life, liberty, and security of the person) However, modern law has been perverted and now ignores the distinctions between rights and powers. Civil powers now run roughshod over individual rights by no longer recognizing unalienable rights. 
As such, laws are in conflict and are being unilaterally balanced by civil authority but true rights cannot be balanced. True rights can never be balanced with, or against, each other because true rights never actually conflict, and therefore do not need to be balanced. True rights will always lead to the same result. When two rights appear to need balancing, one of them does not actually apply.
