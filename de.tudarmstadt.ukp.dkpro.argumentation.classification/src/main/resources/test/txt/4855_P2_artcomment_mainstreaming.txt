Sadly, the best answer to the question of inclusion is "it depends". But that's what IEPs and teams are for. 
My youngest daughter got some WAY early intervention (she was in a Krieger study just after her second birthday) and because of that is in a normal pre-K class with some additional assistance here and there. But that's my daughter and her case; I can think of at least three or so of her earlier peers that might still not be set for such a task. 
Is inclusion possible? Certainly. Is it the preferred option? For those crunching the numbers, probably, but not necessarily for the children, and not necessarily for their parents.
