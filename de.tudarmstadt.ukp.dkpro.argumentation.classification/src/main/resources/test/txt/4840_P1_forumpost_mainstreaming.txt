My 7-year-old son has autism, ADHD, and SID, and he is mainstreamed into a 1st grade classroom now. It's done wonders for him, and his classmates are amazingly compassionate and considerate. If my son gets agitated or frustrated, a classmate will rub his back to calm him down. My son doesn't talk, so his classmates have asked to learn sign language. His teacher brought in someone to teach some signs, so now everyone can communicate. 
He was in special ed preschool for 2 years, and special ed kindergarten for one year, and he's doing so much better in his 1st grade class. He isn't bored, and despite my greatest worries, the other kids are nice to him and he has friends.
