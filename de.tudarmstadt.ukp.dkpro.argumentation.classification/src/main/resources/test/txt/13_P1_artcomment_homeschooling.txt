After read this article, undoubtedly, I oppose the home-schooling intensely. A boy, up to 16, who can hardly possess the fundamental kownledge of science, geography and math. It is terrible, especially in a country like USA with best education and most advanced technology which left the others far behind. Even though C.Powell is pretty responsible for the development of his children, but the accountability seems to stand on the surface. The fact is badly apparent ,i.e when they children grow older, they have to spend large amounts of time on remedial course and the extra energy as well. So the exemption is unreasonable. At this pointt, I honestly expect the administration take relational measures to restrict the right of exemption for thoses people claim that they own the right of religious exemption . In this way, not only the children are truly benefit from the deeds in the future, but also the country as well. As to some specific measures, the draft specify the local officials should test the childrenâ€™s ability periodically. If the children could not reach the proper line. The law can dismiss the exemption for this family, the children should attend to the public school. The draft of law aims to ensure every child in America accept the similar level education. Those who want their children left behind troops, the law should punish them.
