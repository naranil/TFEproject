I work in a "ritzy" county with a lot of money, good salaries and state of the art equipment. We are rarely in compliance and even when we are, it is barely and not effective. What really matters is who shows up yearly, not the actual meeting. Its sad but true. I would lie if I said I went to every single IEP meetin and EMT meeting. I want to, but I just can't. Its not a perfect system anywhere. We need to look at the practice not the intention.
