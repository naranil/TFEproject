Growing up, I had a friend who had a younger brother who was Downs. he was pretty low functioning as I recall. He didn't speak more than 3-4 words in maybe 7th grade (he was a year behind us). All 6 of their kids had been in the public school system until Jonathon was no longer allowed to attend regular classes because of his rages. So they came to our private school where (with what my mom had said was a sizable donation) were able to put Jonathon in a regular class. He had to have a private Aid at all times and class sizes were small. Jonathon was a constant disruption to the school as a whole. We could hear his fits in our classroom next door.... he was asked to leave and the family moved onto a different school... and then a different school. The sister and I remained friends through all that.... But I remember thinking how terrible it was that "we" had to deal with "that". 
Now... I have a special needs child who is almost 6 months old. We have no idea what Molly's limitations will be at this point but I have her in every program and therapy possible to give her the best shot at a *normal* life... I want her to go to a regular school and regular classes. I want her in normal sports... thats my goal for her... however, her brother is one year older and so then I have to remember Jonathon and how I was affected and would I force Molly on him and his classmates? I think if she could not handle it and it was a pipe dream, NO I WOULDN'T. But if she is just marginally behind or just physically behind, I will do my best to see she goes to normal classes.... If it doesn't work for ALL involved, we will make changes as needed... 
Andrews was/is very high functioning, IMO... and as such, I think his parents did the right thing for Andrew but YES, they should have prepared him for the day school was no longer in the picture.... if they didn't, then they harmed him in some ways...
