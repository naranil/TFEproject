The merits or demerits of single sex education is most difficult to conclude. In Trinidad and Tobago for example,there has been a large scale move to make all public high schools not primary ones single sex. In my view the policy was ill thought out, rest on little or no published researched and based on the assumptions that because a few single sex 'prestigious' schools do relatively well it justified the policy! What further gives this policy support, strangely is the applaud of elitist and coveted racist groups that previously argued that mixed schools were designed to propagate race mixing! The fact is however, that the policy does not fulfill stated educational goals but it creates yet another opportunity for segregationist to justify their ideology by pseudoscience. One wonders given what is published on wider American and Caribbean research if the single sex argument is not soon to be turned into a 'single ethnicity' one ending finally in a new apartheid system. !
