Ms.  Wong, Benedikt's reason is in no-way-shape-or-from compelling.  It's a self confessed a manifesto.  It requires a jaundiced eye. While I'm all for public schools; both our kids attend.  Even the best public schools cannot reach every student all of the time.  Additionally, American families hold a plethora of educational positions and beliefs that might move them to choose a private school. American parents have never given up their right to find the best solution for their child nor should they.  In the grey world, it's perfectly possible to believe-in and support public school but choose a private school for your student. http://www.admissionsquest.com/onboardingschools/2013/09/why-we-need-private-schools.html
