I find nothing "compelling" about this authors argument.  We have 5 children and 16 grandchildren who have been home schooled and have gone to charter schools.  We believe in Choice and Agency and all were given the opportunity to attend regular public schools.  We have some of the best public schools in our area of northern Calif.  A few of the children opted for that option, were loved by teachers who gushed at their responsibility, their intellect, their respectful attitudes towards everyone.  Every one of those children opted for returning to charter and home school after experiencing overcrowded classrooms, raunchy behavior and language, and 7 to 8 hour days in dumb downed classes.    "The proof is in the pudding!"   Our children and grandchildren graduated from high school at 13, 14, and 15 years old.  They were at the top 1% of their peers in testing.  The ones old enough to go on  to college have received straight A's, the oldest have their own businesses.  In our family meetings and dinners  (28 of us),  their comments about 4 hour school days filled with exploration, about our world, brings great comfort to my wife and I.  No PC crap, just plain goodness, kindness, understanding about the good and bad in this world, all stemming from our family personal moral, religious, and political perspectives.  This article as well as many on MSN lack substance, lack a grasp of reality, and our at best na√Øve.  Now I am off to give three of our grandchildren their weekly tennis lessons.
