This sounds like some Hippy from the 60s.  So I'm a bad person because we moved to a suburb in 1980. That was the year forced busing was started in our town. Not for education but for integration. Anyone who could get out moved. Look at the inner city schools now. You sound like you might have been one of the plaintiffs in the discrimination case. How has that worked out for ya lady?  Bad education, high drop out rate, very high teen age and interracial pregnancies. And you  think I'm a bad person because I moved away from this. I think it's people like you that has caused this country to be the way it is.
