lurker here..there is only mainstreaming where I live in Canada..ALL special needs not matter what the handicap is..or how severe go into regualr classes..they do go to assisted learning classes for about 1 hr/day to get help w/ reading etc..this works awesome!!..I have a HF autistic son w/ severe ADHD..he is doing awesome in grade 1 he has a 1 on 1 aide in the class..we feel well supported by the school system and he has only 18 in his class!
