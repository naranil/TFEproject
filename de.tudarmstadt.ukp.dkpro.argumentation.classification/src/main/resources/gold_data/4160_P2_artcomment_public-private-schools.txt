What a stupid question and waste of time this article is.  The United States is a free world...for now...and whose business is it to say it is wrong for the wealthy to send their kids to a private school.  That is the problem with our country, too many busy bodies....mind your own business and the wealthy can do whatever they wish with their money.  I am not wealthy, actually not even middle class any longer, and I still agree citizens can do what they want with their money and everyone else should back off.
