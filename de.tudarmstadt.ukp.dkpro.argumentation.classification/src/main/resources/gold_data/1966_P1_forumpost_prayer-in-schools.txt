When I was a kid we learned religion in church, math, reading, history, etc., in school and at home. That has changed because of immigrants, the world just in general becoming smaller through computers, TV., and people becoming more independent from their own study and reading. 
Why are some people making it so difficult, demanding that religion be taught also in schools, alongside science? What will Americans do when Arabs wear headscarves, burkas to public school as is happening in Europe? Notice these are only women's wear, which creates another gigantic problem of suppression of the female (Americans think). 
We have some problems to face, don't we? The entire world has these problems, not just here in America, and we are the guineau pigs.
