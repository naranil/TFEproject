1) You basically just insulted the Christian God. 2) While I do believe in no help from God without the putting out of effort on the worshipper, I do not believe as stated in a previous reply, that prayer in the Christian religion is about asking for good things that you want, but for the forgiveness of our trespasses and for the well being of those around us. IT is for spiritual protection, forgiveness, and for some it is a way to keep their heads high in this dismal world.
