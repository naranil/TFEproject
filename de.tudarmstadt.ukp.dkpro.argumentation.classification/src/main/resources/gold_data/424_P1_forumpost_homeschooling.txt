My parents decided to Homeschool me (and the rest of my siblings) because they did not want me exposed to all of the crap that goes on in public schools. All the drugs, swearing, bullying, condoms being handed out to young children who shouldn't even know what sex is yet, evolution. etc....why would you put your child in that situation? (No offense to anyone here, don't take this wrongly.)

This film changed my perspective on public schools tremendously. Here is the preview.
But besides that, God has commanded us to train up our children, not give them to someone else where you have no control over what they are taught. And what they are taught is directly against him. 
Perhaps some Homeschool kids are 'awkward" and all that, but all the ones I know, are not. My friend and her family are Homeschoolers and they are all friendly and funny and wonderfully nice people. My other friend is super-mega smart and got a fantastic education. She ended up going to be a Missionary/English teacher. Her sister, in college now, and she's such a sweet person. None of my friends or siblings are messed up, because they have been taught well. 
I don't agree with overprotectiveness but I do agree with parents doing their jobs. Being parents. 
"To control the future requires the control of education and of the child.  Hence, for Christians to tolerate statist education, or to allow their children to be trained thereby, means to renounce power in society, to renounce their children, and to deny Christ's Lordship over all of life.”   ―    R.J. Rushdoony
