A question: When did Allison Benedikt join the Communist Party? Seriously, when did Ms. Benedikt join the CPUSA? Parents who want the best for their children are bad people? This is precisely the argument Josef Stalin made during the Soviet holocaust-that-never-was in 1953 (a/k/a The Doctors' Plot). Too many Jews were giving their children privileged educations at the expense of the majority--and hence more deserving--GOYIM. Do I have the obligation to sacrifice MY children on the altar of the COLLECTIVE? Ms. Benedikt thinks so. I THINK NOT.
