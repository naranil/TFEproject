I too believed that out nation is under a great fall due taking prayer out of schools and attempting to take God out of everything we do. Our country has lost morales and respect for God. This country in now the most liberal county, we allow everything to go. After all that God has done to make this the richest land ever, this is how we show our thanks. But do remember â€“ God is not mocked. Every knee shall bow, and every tongue will confess the Jesus Christ is Lord. There will be reprecusions for the choices that have been made without God.
