I regard single sex education as bad. One thing that I hope all people learn in school is to get along with other people. I don't think that home schooling is good for children and I don't think that single sex schooling is good for children either. In a coed school children deal with each other as individuals. They learn to regard members of the opposite sex as people. In order to get along in adult society most occupations require that their practitioners get along with both men and women. This is a skill that is not learned in a single sex environment. 
A second reason I deplore single sex schools is that girls and women are shortchanged as far as math and science are concerned. My observations of women who were products of girls schools is that they do not have the same preparation that women who are products of coed schools do. One friend of mine, a product of a girl's high school, had to take remedial courses so that she could satisfactorily take college level science course.
