Our country operates under the US Constitution which is the Supreme Law of the Land the colonists of many beliefs, cultures, creeds and backgrounds fought and died for in the Revolutionary war to expel a distant omnipotent British King from interfering in their lives. Let's face it, religion has historically been the crux of most human cruelty and warfare in this world, and our founding fathers were not only acutely aware of these facts, but personally knew how dangerous religion can be to a society if it's not kept in check (see Church of England ). 
The primary objective of schooling is to provide children with the tools necessary to go out into the world and support themselves so they will not be a burden upon society, period. Religion is a personal choice that one accepts or rejects, whereby, 98% of children take on the beliefs of their parents. I know for A FACT Christians would be up in arms if they were forced to pray or accept Buddah, so why they have come to believe its OK to force Buddists and others to pray to their religious icon (god) is beyond me. Don't get me wrong , I have no problem with a student conducting a SILENT prayer before a test, eating lunch or easing some stress , but it should never be incorporated into the ciriculum or activities where children of many different beliefs/non-beliefs must go for the sole purpose of obtaining an education . 
This is exactly WHY our founding fathers incorporated the first amendment into the "Bill of Rights", so no one religion could invade the freedoms, liberty and rights of others to choose their own beliefs without interference, especially from the government ! Like they say "your rights end at the tip of my nose" and when I go to school it's to learn the three R's, not be subjected to religious dogma.
