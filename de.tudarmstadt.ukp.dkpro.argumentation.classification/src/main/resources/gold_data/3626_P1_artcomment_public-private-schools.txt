Parents deserve the right to choose the education for their children without being judged for it.  I grew up in private schools for a variety of reasons and it has helped me to succeed in ways that I may not have been able to if I had attended the public schools in my area.  My parents were involved parents who dutifully paid their taxes supporting the public school system while also paying my tuition.  They are far from bad parents and anyone suggesting otherwise is, at best, close minded and judgmental.
