In Chicago, Illinois (USA), the school district instituted a policy that required 6 YOs to be placed in 1st grade if their parents held them back from Kindergarten. Redshirting has become such an issue there that the school district felt they had no choice. 
I can certainly understand it if the parents feel the kid isn't ready, but what I'm hearing a lot of in our area is parents (particularly of boys) doing it because they feel it will make their kid the "class leader" or the "best" in sports (which is ridiculous IMHO). One of the girls I went to high school with went redshirted two of her three boys because of the sports issue alone (apparently, she didn't know she had the option with the first one but would have redshirted his too if she had known). She claims it makes a "huge" difference for sports. Personally, I'm not sending my kids to school to play sports. I'm sending them there to learn. Plus, from my own sports experience, age has little to do with sports once you hit the high school level anyway -- I played Varsity Volleyball and Varsity Track as a freshman (when I was 14). Most of the team was made up of seniors and juniors (who were 3 to 4 years older than me). And really, how can you as a parent feel proud of your child and feel that he is "better" at sports than his classmates when his classmates are 2 years younger than him. Seems a tad delusional to me. 
For us, we are having the opposite issue -- we are sending our 4 YO twins to kindergarten early because they are academically, socially and physically ready. They miss the cut off by three months here, so it's been an issue finding a placement for them. So all this redshirting means that they are likely to have kids who are 2 years older then them in the same class as them by first grade.
