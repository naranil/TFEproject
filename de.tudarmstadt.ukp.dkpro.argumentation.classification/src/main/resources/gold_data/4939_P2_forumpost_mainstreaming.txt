Hi
I am wondering if this meeting will form part of her her Annual Review? If she has a statement then this type of meeting should take place to review support and make plans for the coming year. It is often the case that a range of professionals will be invited to an Annual Review. Many schools also access support from their local Outreach Team so this is not unusual but the parents whould be involved in this process so that ideas and suggestions can be carried out at home as well. 
Specialist provision could be suggested if the school feel that they are unable to meet her needs anymore. If it is possible for them, with support, to continue the provision as it is then this should be considered as well. Many mainstream schools successfully support children with considerable additional needs as long as they are able to get the support levels right. It may mean that the school needs more training or needs to pull in more support but this is far from impossible. Your friend should also be asked for her views so it is worth thinking this through before the meeting. 
If your friend is feeling apprehensive about the meeting then she can request that someone from her localaccompany her. She may also find it helpful to contact bothandfor more advice. 
Please let us know how she gets on
