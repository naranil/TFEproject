I said inferior. Being a very proud atheist, I've no time for foolish followings of beliefs that perpatrate wars, belittle and repress women and terrorize people. Yes, inferior is what I said. Foolish are those who go to battle over believing in stories conceived back when people wondered where the sun dissappeared at night and the world was flat. That is inferior and foolish. To believe in one's self and hold morals of treating your fellow brothers and sisters is superior to all mankind, not just groups of foolish individules believing their religion is better than another's religion.
