The only reason why we decided to take out daughter of private school this year is because of the price. Up until now we were able to afford it, but with my long commute everyday and gas prices and all other prices not coming down we had to make a very difficult decision. And believe me it has been an adjustment. Not just the private to public adjustment but also day care. Wow!!! If I have the choice and the opportunity to do so I will gladly put her back in private scholl without hesitation. Not only is the learning environment better and more organized so are the teaching practices. In the private setting she is not being taught how to pass a test so that the school can remain accredited or whatever she is being taught how to think and organize her ideas, and she is actually graded, and not passed along if she can just get by. I like the fact that she is being challenged by her school work and even being pushed to begin learning at least a grade level higher. I remember when I went to public school and it just seemed that the teachers cared about more than their yearly raises and making sure the school got enough money each year from the government. I am democrat and I vote just like everybody else, but I can see the public school system just isn't what it used to be and that's why I want to send her to private school. If we could afford it, I would home school and be done with the system all together.
