Catholic schools teach students how society works on a secular and non-secular world. The school is not there  to protect the student, rather to guide the way and offer choices on how they will become part of society. God's greatest gift to mankind is Free Will, but we must all learn how to handle this responsibility. Catholic schools go beyond the rules and teach society lessons through cause and effect.
