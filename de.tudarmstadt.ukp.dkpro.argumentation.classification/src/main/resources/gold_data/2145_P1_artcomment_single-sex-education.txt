Cut down on the (misogynistic) bigotry in the classroom and society and there won't be any perceived "need" for single-gender classrooms. Honestly, of all the groups of people to be put through "separate but equal," gender should be the least likely. Seriously, our society depends on us interacting with each, at the very least, since we each make up over half the damn species!
