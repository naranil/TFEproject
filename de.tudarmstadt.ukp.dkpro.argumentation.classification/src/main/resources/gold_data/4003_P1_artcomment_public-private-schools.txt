I couldn't come up with a more illogical argument.  Parents of private school kids know absolutely nothing would change in the few years their children would attend a public school, even if they voiced their concerns.  So, why waste valuable development years in a childs life when a parent could enroll their child in a private school and give them a better education immediately?  Seriously, do you think the same teachers who continually go on strike for better wages and less demanding grading scales would listen to parents and actually incorporate suggested changes into their classrooms?
