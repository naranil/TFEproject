What a joke !!! First of all, those of us who send our children to private schools are also paying for the public schools at the same time through our property taxes. Is we choose to send our children to a different , more expensive school in order to provide them with a better education, So be it.  The Public School System is a mess in many districts and it's not the responsibility of the parent to sacrifice their child's education in order to keep that failing system going.  My personal experience with the public schools in many districts is that they teach to the lowest common denominator. The disruptive child gets more attention and takes away from the time spent on the rest of the class. In the private school system, the administration is more able to deal with the difficult student, even if that mean expelling them from the school.  Most people who send their children to private schools would prefer to save the money and go public... if only that system could provide a first class education. The point of view that those of us who pay for a private education are some how contributing to the failing public system is just crazy
