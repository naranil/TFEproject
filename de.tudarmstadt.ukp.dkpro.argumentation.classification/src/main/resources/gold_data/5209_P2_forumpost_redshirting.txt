Karen - in our District, you can start early. They test you in. The child has to score X on a set of tests, and then they interview the child and the parents (to make sure they aren't crazy I guess lol). Every year one or two girls make the cut - these are usually girls who are smart and miss the cutoff by a day or two. Its great that you have this option. DD has a good friend who I guess didn't score high enough, missed the cutoff by 2 days and is now in class with DD. She is so out of place I feel so bad for her. She's like a foot taller than everyone else (she's supertall - she's taller than 4th and 5th graders poor thing) and I'm sure she will get her period a year earlier than everyone else and have to wear a bra earlier - I wonder if this isn't going to emotionally stress her out on the other end, when she is older. 
I guess my point is that in a perfect world (where everyone has time and money lol) they would do the same sort of objective standards testing for parents who wish to redshirt. So, they'd test them and they'd have to score UNDER X number on standardized tests. And they'd interview the child to see their maturity level. I'm sure a bunch would make the cut but the other snowflake ones, they'd force the parents to send their child to school on time.
