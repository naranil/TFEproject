Of course fear was the motivator here, a good portion of it from the House of Un-American Activities/Joseph McCarthy 50s... not all. But we also have to look at the wide group of settlers who came here before it was a nation to avoid religious persecution, all too often to start their own more favored type of persecution. 
There has always been some group driving for ideological/religious purity, and I believe the thought that we have to have that in public schools is part of that drive. (Not labeling ALL who think it might be better, just to be clear, but I would think a lot.) 
One must also wonder if old fashioned reciting type memorization leads all too easily to adding something like the pledge or a prayer: group mind think. Simply change the content a bit and some so strongly pro would say it's brain washing. And they would be right to a certain extent: in both cases.
