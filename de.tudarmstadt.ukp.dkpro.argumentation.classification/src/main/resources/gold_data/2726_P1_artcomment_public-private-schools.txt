This is nuts.  I went to a crappy high school.  this was 1970.  Nobody seemed to care what we did.  There were knife fights and drugs all over.  There was no guidance from any of the teachers and my guidance counselor was a joke.  He seem surprised that I was even going to the University and not the local Junior College to learn a trade and gave me no advise how to achieve it.  In the University, I found out what they didn't teach me in high school and I was behind much of the first year.  I graduated and went back and got an MBA.  When my kids got old enough for school, I sent them to private school and they were ready for University work.  My kids both have nice professional jobs.  I pay my school taxes but public schools don't want my input, just my money.
