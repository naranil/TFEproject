DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE CALLING ME A BAD PARENT!  I am not wealthy, my daughter went to both private, public and back to private. Even with a reputation of a good school district, I have a child with special needs. She had no time to sit on a waiting list for services, secluded programs, as I was even willing to pay. I fought for her, her doctors fought for her with zero results. I made those payments, I gave up vacations, and even my car. Today she works, goes to a great college, does not live off a system. Let me remind you, the public school wanted to keep her until she was 21! To do what? By now she has two years of college in, working on Chemical Engineer Degree.  She works to pay for college. Not to  live on a system that would have done nothing but spent your money. NOW CALL ME A BAD PARENT!!!
