Hi Carol
This is such sound advise and thank goodness there are Head Teachers like yourself out there!! 
My Son has complex needs and starts mainstream in September and it makes me angry when I hear Parents like Joanne having such a struggle to find a place for their Child 
I agree too, that although labels are scary for Parents, with them, the Children do get more benefits and support, so can be a positive thing
