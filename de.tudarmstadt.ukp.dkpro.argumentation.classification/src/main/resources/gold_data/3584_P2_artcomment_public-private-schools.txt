I believe that it's all about location. I am from a small town and the public school system here is wonderful. Both of my children will graduate with 15 - 21 hours of college credit. Then there is the school system that is only 20 minutes away from my town, where my husband and I lived before we had children, it is not the best. They do not offer the same type of classes nor do they push the children to be better. If I stilled lived in that school system my children would be in private schools. But we can not always just blame the schools for the way our children learn. We must look at ourselves, such as are we involved in our children's education, these teachers only have them for a short period of time we as parents must extend their education beyond what is being taught in the schools public or private. Remember our children's education started the day we conceived them. It is our responsibility as parents to continue that through out their lives we cannot always rely on others.
