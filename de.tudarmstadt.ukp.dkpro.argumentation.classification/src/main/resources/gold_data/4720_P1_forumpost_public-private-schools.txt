If you in Cape Town and your child loves playing cricket , send him to Wynberg boys high!
what a terrific school it is!
I went there in 2009 with my highschool in a cricket tour...i went to rondebosch , sacs/sax (forgot) , wynberg and another school that i cant remember 
model c or private school is your best bet!
make sure however , you send your kid to extra tuitions after school for problem subjects because i can safely say that when i was in school , sports was more important rather than academics ... everyone wants to be 1st team in cricket , soccer and rugby
