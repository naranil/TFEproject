This is a topic which has received a lot, probably too much, of my consciousness the last four years--basically since my oldest was a year old.  I went to a private, parochial school that had 200 kids from K-8. I then attended a publicly funded high school (my parents gave us all a choice during the transition from elementary to high school).  I experienced a huge culture shock!  I went from a pool of essentially all white, middle to middle-upper class kids to an ocean of every demographic and culture conceivable.  My grades suffered, and so did my self image.  Had my primary education been different in a few regards--namely, more exposure to those of diverse backgrounds and varying capabilities, I think I really would have been a better balanced person able to handle the huge dynamics of a public high school. To Jamondown, if anything, private schools are highly traditional and convergent in pedagogy.  Variation from the curriculum is typically not tolerated. While a side of me appreciates your cynicism, I don't think you really touch the surface of this contentious issue.   After much deliberation, my husband and I decided to get our child into a publicly funded magnet program in our home town.  We had to put his name in a lottery, and then bite our nails because he had a 1:3 chance of getting in.  The reason we chose this route is because 1) our district school had below national average scores, an indicator to me that there is a high level of variability in the classroom, most likely due to having high percentage of ESL students, 2) tuition costs would be hefty for all three of our children (average annual is $3-4k), and 3) we know that he's getting the love, support, cultural exposure, and intellectual challenge at home. So, our oldest is going to a public magnet (which, incidentally, emerged in our home town after de-segregation as a way to continue the cultural division), and our twins are currently in a public montessori pre-school with intentions to begin kindergarten at the magnet school once old enough.   I intend to be fully active in the PTA and every aspect of my children's lives as they go through their education, AND we'll have $12,000 left in pocket to spend on furthering their educational and cultural enrichment.
