I was sent to private schools my first 7 of years of schooling. It went great as far as academics and learning. Then, I was switched to public schooling in a "better" district, and my grades went from A's to D's. It wasn't that I was stupid or that my parents wouldn't help, it was that I was bored to tears and had teachers who, even obvious to a 7th grader, HATED their jobs. Good parents do what is best for their children, and they already support public schools with their tax dollars whether or not their children attend. So, I guess by the author's reasoning, we're ALL "good" people.
