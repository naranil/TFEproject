Benedikt, your reasoning is totally wrong. Rich people send their kids to private school cause local school is bad, but rich lives there and pay tax, they actually support it. Your argument just leaves the rich to move to a better place with better public school, and let the local bad school getting worse becasue of shortage of revenue from tax.
