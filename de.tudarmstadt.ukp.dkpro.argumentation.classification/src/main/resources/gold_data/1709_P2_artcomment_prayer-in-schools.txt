I know first hand that prayer in public schools is not dead. I am a christian but I attend a public, secular college university. I attended a sports awards banquet last night. Before the meal we had and the ceremony, an athletic staff member got up and delivered a public invocation, or blessing, for the meal and the ceremony. Surprisingly enough, nobody stood up in anger or hatred. Nobody got up shouting pleas of detest. those who wanted to participated in the prayer, and those who didnt simply sat there in silence and showed respect for those who did participate. As hard as the government tries, they will never full banish religious practices in schools. God is too powerful and so are his believers
