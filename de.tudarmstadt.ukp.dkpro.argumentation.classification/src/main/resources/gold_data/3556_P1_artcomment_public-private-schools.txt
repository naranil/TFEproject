There is no education in public schools any more! The government, teachers unions and political correctness has killed them. If you want you children to get a good education, private is the only way to do it! And no I don't feel guilty when I vote no on tax increases for their budget. Throwing good money after bad never works. Just look at how our government is run now. Most wasteful in history!
