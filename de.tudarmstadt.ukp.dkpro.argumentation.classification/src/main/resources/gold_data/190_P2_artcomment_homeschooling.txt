I don't understand what anti-leftist war-mongering Americans find so troubling about public education in the USA. It is no impediment at all to the war-lovers. When Bush 43 decided to wage a unilateral war of aggression against Iraq 10 years ago, most Americans fell into lockstep like Kim Jong Il's brainwashed North Korean subjects. So what's the problem?
