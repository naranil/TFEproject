That's what I see in my homeschooled gk's. I don't have an issue with homeschooling but think they should be allowed to play with the local kids that don't go to thier church, play community sports and such. I worries me but yes I do keep my mouth shut some times it's kind of hard when your having a conversation with gs who mentions he'd like to try playing soccer.
