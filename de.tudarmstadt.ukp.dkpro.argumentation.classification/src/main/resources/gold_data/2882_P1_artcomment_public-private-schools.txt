The comment this girl made was: I hate all white people! I tried to get my grand-daughter out of that classroom but was refused. This girl was constantly in fights, bullying someone, stealing something, in trouble all the time. She actually said she wanted to be kicked out of school. She didn't want to be there anyway.  The parents of these kids are NOT doing their job in bringing them up right. My grand-daughter knows many multi-racial kids and friends with all, sleep-overs, going to parties, going to movies and even they have problems with these kids that bully, steal, fight and generally cause trouble.  Their families too are looking everywhere they can to put their kids into better schools. The public schools have delinquents going there. The normal kids do need to go to charter and/or private schools.
