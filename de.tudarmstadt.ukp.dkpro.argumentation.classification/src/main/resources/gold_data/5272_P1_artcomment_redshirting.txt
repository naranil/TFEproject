In this state, the school has little say over who can be held back; it is entirely up to the parents. A good many of our kindergarteners show up without the behaviors that will allow them to succeed, and with the behaviors which make it hard to teach others. You don't need to write books about something that takes the average teacher about 30 seconds to realize. When you advance your child, despite indications that you should not, you push social development before cognitive development, which many experts now hold as interdependent. That means your child may not have the skills to be successful at grade level. And contrary to the old saying, it will not work out in the wash. It does not help that the average adult here functions with what amounts to an eighth grade education. Mostly, we end up with middle school aged children who are reading at third or fourth grade level, rendering grade appropriate textbooks and reading material useless. If you really, really care about your child, take an interest in them early. Read to them, and encourage them to at least become familiar with letters and counting. DO NOT PLOP THEM IN FRONT OF A TV SCREEN, and leave them unattended. Talk about what you watched. Those of you who will not accept responsibility for your parenting (or lack thereof), those of you who switch schools every half year because your child "doesn't fit in," and those of you who hold the school responsible for fixing YOUR mistakes are the cancer that is killing American education.
