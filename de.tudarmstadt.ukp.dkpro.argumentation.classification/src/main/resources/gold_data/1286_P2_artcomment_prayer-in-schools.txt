Hmm, my original post didn't get in...
Seems to be missed in this article, the important paragraph about WHY they did it. The students cut class to go to prayer and don't come back? Then suspend them. How would someone who was Hindu or Catholic be treated if they didn't come back in the afternoon? They'd be failed. Pointe finale. 
But THAT would mean the School Board would have to treat them the same as the rest of the population, and once again, we are reading Animal Farm. When are these Board officials going to grow a backbone? Are they afraid of something or someone? This kind of backing away from confrontation has to stop. 
If these comments about how females get treated are true, the prayer group and School Board members who voted this in should be charged with racism.
