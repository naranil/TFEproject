MiddleEnglandLefty,
It's nothing to do with teaching "revolutionary ideals" just a curriculum different from that dictated by the state. 
I suspect that home schooling would be a whole lot less popular if, instead of the state using our tax money to run an education system itself, it allowed freedom to choose independent schools which provided alternative curricula.
