It’s amazing all the people who truly believe a simple prayer should be not be uttered in the public arena . Our Founding Fathers NEVER believed of supported this. They prayed in public and supported prayers given by public officials – recognizing the Divine help and guidance given in the forming of this Nation . The phrase ‘separation of church and State ‘ is not in the Constitution . That was a construct of the Warren Court . That phrase was written in a letter by Thomas Jefferson to a group of Baptists in Danbury Conn. He stated that the First Amendment would provide a wall of separation between the government and them, so that the State could not hinder them from practicising their faith as they saw fit . That was the true origin of the phrase and it’s meaning . It no way, and in no form did our Founding Fathers mean to eliminate prayer or faith from the public area .
