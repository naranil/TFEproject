I know in this state the kids have to pass a yearly assesment test. They will take away your rights to homeschool based on the outcome of the testing, I think that's a good thing. My problem is when a parent doesn't put the effort in to socialize the kids, they are in too narrow of a group of friends and not allowed any friends out side of that group.
