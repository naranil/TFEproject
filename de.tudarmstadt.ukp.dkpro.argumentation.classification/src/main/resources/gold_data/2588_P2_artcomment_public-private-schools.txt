This is all communist-minded dribble.  Equalize everyone and everything, don't dare do what's best for your kid becuase in some obscure, imaginative way, it might hurt the masses of people?   If this person really wants to fix public schools, kick out the non-performers who don't learn anything and don't care anyway.  Focus your resources on the investments that pay off.  Divert your money away from the money pits.   Oh, nevermind, I'm talking to a far left communist, this makes no sense to those types.
