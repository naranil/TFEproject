My older son, entered public kindergarten this year at the age of 5-1/2. He is enjoys school and his friends. Due in part to federal mandates related to No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, and the newly adopted Common Core standards, he had three assessments (reading, math and a state mandated one) in the first 5 weeks of school. His teacher also had the class in for weekly test prep in the computer lab - they don't use computers for any other purpose evidently that testing the kids. 
While he has known the full alphabet since he was two years old, his fine motor skills have been slower to develop, particularly since he is bilaterally-abled (left-handed but uses both hands). There is a huge emphasis on reading and writing skills development in kindergarten, work that used to be in first grade. There is also a lot of sitting down doing worksheets. From what I've read this is not based on brain development research but on politics and educational fads. 
I can see how a child born closer to the cut-off date might not be ready for the work, particularly a very active child. My younger son is two and is super bright and athletic, it's too soon to know if he will be able to handle being in such a passive learning environment. I wish public schools really employed differentiated learning.
