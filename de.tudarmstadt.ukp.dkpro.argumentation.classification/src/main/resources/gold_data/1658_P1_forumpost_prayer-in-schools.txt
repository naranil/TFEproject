I'm a teacher. If a student wishes to silently pray during my class, I do not have a problem with it. However, when they want to pray out loud or with a group, I consider that a disruption and therefore not acceptable. I also don't think teachers/administrators leading prayers over the intercom or whatever are acceptable. However, voluntary, non-disruptive, silent prayer is fine.
