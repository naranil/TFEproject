Skipped, you bring up a good point. During my studies of multiple intelligence theory boys were talked about extensively because our current public school system is not always necessarily directed based on young male or children with different learning styles needs. Right now, the majority of schools curriculum & learning styles are set up for little girls who can sit at their desk for long periods of time. Which is not easy for a lot of boys. 
There is a lot of talk about changing the way we teach, I don't think it'll happen any time soon. But I think the prospect of using MI Theory for all children will eliminate a lot of children falling through the cracks & at the same time, promote their individual strengths and develop a love of learning vs getting frustrated & throwing their hands up.
