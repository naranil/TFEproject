i have read the majority of the liberal, give them what they want comments,,,,,,,, and can see where the silent majority once again has remained silent too long. the lines of serious interfaith breaching are all too clear to this guy. just remember..... as these minorities attain their goals one by one, there will be no returning to any long gone status quo. you and your children and their children will be paying for your lack of faith and arrogance. glad i am old and wont live to see the whirlwind.
