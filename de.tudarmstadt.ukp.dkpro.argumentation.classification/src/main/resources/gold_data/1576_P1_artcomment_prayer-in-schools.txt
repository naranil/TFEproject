There is no place for religion in schools nor should taxpayers subsidize any religion's prayer services. I do not care if the person is Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Zorastrian, Buddhist, Jainist, Wiccan, Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, or Pagan their beliefs belong in premises financed by their believers not the government. 
Constitutionally, Canada has no religion, although some mistakenly believe we are a Christian nation even though legally that argument has no ground. Lets keep it that way. Allowing prayer in schools leads to prosetylization and that is unacceptable.
