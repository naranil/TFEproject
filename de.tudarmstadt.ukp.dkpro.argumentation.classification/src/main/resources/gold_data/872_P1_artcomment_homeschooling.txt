Oh come on. Teachers in schools are also subject to intrusive checks, the assumption that they would abuse a child as soon as look at them and constant surveillance. No one is claiming "the professionals" are the only ones who can teach. I wish. 
What this is about is when a child is being abused by parents, teachers notice and they report it. So, some parents take their children out of school and abuse them so they do not get caught. 
If no one is checking up, no one has noticed their child's bruises and withdrawal and misery. And so children die. It is not a widespread problem, no one is claiming that. It is just a Get of Jail Free card to a very small minority of people. 
Just because the vast majority of home educators are good, loving and decent parents cannot mean that the few children at risk *must* be ignored to give you all privacy.
