This statement...“There are a lot of reasons why bad people send their kids to private school,” Benedikt wrote....is absolutely a lie! Bad people...Give Me A Break! I think it is a very loving thing, a good and decent thing to send children to a private school! Do we still not live in the free United States of America??? I would like to say that the programs that the public schools are pushing are "bad" and teaching children to become more dependant upon our government where private schools teach self responsibility and good character...how dare this person call us bad if we chose to use our private schools...as a parent of a terrific private school system...I know we all have to work extra hard to keep these private schools running and that is also teaching our children persistence...and how to care for one another without depending on Uncle Sam to come in and pick up the pieces...are you kidding me by judging all parents who know and believe in a Higher Power than themselves...now that is a refreshing statement for Ms. Benedikt to mull over along with all of her secular ideas that the public school system is pumping into our children. You say she has a compelling argument...I say "NOT"!
