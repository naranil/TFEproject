Hello,
I constantly hear and read the cliches ( no offense ), "I am not ______, but I don't the ______ should do _______.". Give me a break! Either there is Religious Freedom or there is not. "How long will you waiver between two opinions?" All or Nothing people, there cannot be middle ground. Why? Well, duh, it is this simple: Religion is a structure of beliefs that influence everything you do, think, and say. It by definition must be NUMERO UNO in all areas of life. Saying a student or a teacher can't pray is a OBVIOUS VIOLATION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM! WAKE UP AMERICA, PLEASE! 
Thanks, Michael Byrd
