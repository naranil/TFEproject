I'll send my kid to private school thanks. It has nothing to do with prestige or family tradition. I just want him to have the best education he can get.   Fixing the broken public school system from within will never work, because you will only be one voice among the many who could care less about the quality of the education provided as long as the school keeps providing what amounts to free childcare during the day.
