The problem is that you are only looking at 5 and 6 year olds. I teach middle school and see a HUGE difference in abilities between the younger and older kids. The gap then continues to get wider due to confidence issues. The gap is even wider with boys vs girls because of maturity levels. There have been a lot of studies that show people born later in the year (March) are more successful in life due to the age gap. My In our state, we have one of the youngest start ages (5 by Dec 31st). My daughter was born on the cut off date. I held her back.
