This is a false premise.  The schools are messed up due to politics and not a lack of funds or participation.  If schools would take the politics out of the classrooms and just teach kids basic skills a lot of people would return.  Why on earth should I allow my precious child to be indoctrinated into liberal political non-sense and also be exposed to the misbehaving, cretenous off-spring of liberal parents?
