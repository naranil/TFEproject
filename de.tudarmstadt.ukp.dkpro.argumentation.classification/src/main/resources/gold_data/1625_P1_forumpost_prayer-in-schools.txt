The bible says to pray in private. It also says to not use God's name in vain. It's ironic that it is viewed as anti-christian to not want prayer at school and in public venues, to not want "In God We Trust" on our money, and to not want "One nation under God" in the pledge of allegiance because we really haven't earned that claim. Funny I really could care less if people are offended by these things, but I am quite concerned that God might be. As far as prayer in school, I think a moment of silence to allow a private prayer of any type for anyone who wishes to give such is most appropiate.
