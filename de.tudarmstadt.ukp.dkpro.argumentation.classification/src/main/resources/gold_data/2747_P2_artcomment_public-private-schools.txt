Who says that the school system should be the only faucet to educate, their are parents who stay at home with a college education, most in education, what makes them less educated than the teachers in the school system.  In fact it shows that kids who have more one on one time with an educator do better, the school system cannot offer that to children, where do I get that statistic, by public school system who teaches my son with autism.  He needs a one on one with a teacher, but the school system cannot pay for it. And do not say its because of those that are home schooled, because those parents still pay taxes to the school.  This is a joke, thanks to all those at home educators investing in the lives of their children.
