Sorry folks...the "bad parent" argument is completely insane !  Cute title though - certainly stirred up a response.  Why would you "risk" your child's ability to be resilient & 'probably' do ok, in a crappy school - when you can improve your odds and start the race in a better place - with better tools ? That reminds me of when Unions pushed their people to "only drive American made cars" - even though they sucked !  Sorry dudes...make better products - and "they" will come !  American car companies got a SHOCK that forced them to step up their game - or become irrelevant, and they got better because of it.  So too should the public school systems find ways to create better students...or close the doors.  Now don't get me wrong...there are "A LOT" of VERY legitimate reasons "why" most public school systems suck, and I think there's definitely a HUGE crisis - particularly in the lower socio-economic areas.  I'd just rather focus a bit more deeply on the root causes of the crisis (lack of resources, cookie-cutter teaching approaches, crowded rooms, ill-equipped teachers, disengage parents, doctored / 'standardized' testing...etc) - rather than the consequences of the problem.  If I had to pick one potential 'private school bad parent' opportunity to watch out for though, it'd be more around the awareness of privilege. When private school kids were raised to think "I pulled myself up by my bootstraps - and so should everyone else" (...Mr./Mrs poor person) - they're being blind to the opportunities they had.  I think the "private" education community (generally speaking...), with all of that 'great' education, could benefit from a bit more education around cultural competency.  It saddens me  that many 'educated' folks have only skin-deep understanding of the very significant & often debilitating impact a poor education (and all of its associated context) has. That can lead to an insensitive and often unrealistic 'solution' to the education problem.  Individual efforts get the focus & praise....and 'group privilege' becomes invisible - so the 'symptoms' argument continues.  Bummer...
