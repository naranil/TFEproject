Even though the public school system in my area is good, I chose to enroll my daughter in a private school because she needed a smaller classroom setting and more one-on-one time with a teacher.  Her father and I were going through a divorce when she started kindergarten, and we both felt she would do better in a smaller class than having 20-25 odd other children vying for the teacher's attention.  She loves her teacher, her grades are excellent, and she has made a lot of friends, both in her school and from the public schools.  So if this reasoning makes me a bad person in the eyes of the writer, so be it.
