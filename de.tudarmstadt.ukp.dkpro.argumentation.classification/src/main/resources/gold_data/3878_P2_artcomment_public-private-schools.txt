As a public school administrator, I have to say I find the argument less than persuasive.  (Like my neighbors, I contribute to the funding base for our local schools, regardless that any personal benefit from this is subjective and conditional. I'll never have a student in those schools. And yet, my input and support remain difficult to quantify.)  This argument (from the article,) just smacks of the same unbalanced reasoning.  What's the converse argument?  People without children in the public school system should have no or a lesser role?
