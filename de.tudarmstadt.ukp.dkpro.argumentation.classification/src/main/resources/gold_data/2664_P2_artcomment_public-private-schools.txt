This argument is ridiculous and flawed for a number of reasons. Namely, there is no "one-size fits all" formula for educating children. Every child is different and deserves the ability to seek the education that best suits their needs. Anything controlled by the government inevitably turns into a bureaucracy which is particularly damaging in education. You can not test every child on one set of specified guidelines. Secondly, the quality of education a child receives is primarily the responsibility of the parents regardless of whether the child attends a private or public school. A dedicated parent can make sure the child receives a good education regardless of where they attend school.
