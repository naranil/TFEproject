What a bizarre move. Public schools are NOT places for relgioun. Period. If you want your kid to go to a relgious school, fine, just pay for it yourself; otherwise, keep your mythology to yourself and keep it out of public schools. 
This goes for the catholic board as well; either stop public funding for the catholic board, or be prepared to publically pay for religious schools of ALL stripes.
