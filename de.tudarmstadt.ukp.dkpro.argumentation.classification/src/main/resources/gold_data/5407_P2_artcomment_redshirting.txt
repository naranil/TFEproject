It sounds like he is ready to me! The cut off date here is September 30. My son has an August birthday, and school starts at the end of July, so he turned 5 in Kindergarten. He is now thriving in 3rd grade, and doing better than one of his redshirted classmates. He would’ve been so bored with an extra year of preschool. My eldest girl is a January baby, and will start Kindergarten this year. My youngest girl is only two, and has a mid-September birthday. We’re moving this summer, and I don’t know what the cutoff is in our new district, but I’m hoping that it’s the same and she’ll be ready at almost five. I worry she’ll be bored too, plus it will be nice to stop paying $800 per month for daycare.
