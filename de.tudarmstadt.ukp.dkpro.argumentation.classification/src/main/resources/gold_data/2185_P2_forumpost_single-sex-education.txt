That's a tough one, how do you that?
She relates well with boys, hates Justin Beiber, and boys are not on the radar at the moment. We have close friends that have 2 boys and when we catch up they go about their merry way and play a variety of games (ages 8-12). However how she'll change in year 9 is anybody's guess. I know you can't stop nature and yes I have heard all those stories about girl schools, it does depend on the crowd they mix with in each instance. I know she is confident enough in either setting, and interacting with boys is not an issue, I just wonder how much better their learning will be in al all girl environment? Perhaps I'm splitting hairs, maybe I'll toss a coin!
