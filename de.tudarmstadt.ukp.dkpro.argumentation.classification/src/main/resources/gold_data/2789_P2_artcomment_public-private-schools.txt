Part of what seems "failing in schools" is that standards have been raised and no one is supposed to fall through the cracks anymore. Remember those old TV movies where guys in their 50's had actually faked their way through school and life and someone discovered they were "illiterate?" Can't happen. You will be found out and remediated if for no other reason than the school needed you to improve your test score. In such an environment, it only takes one subgroup not improving for a whole school to be labeled failing. Many of you will have your stories of bad school experiences in this regard. But it is the whole picture, not generalization from your legitimately bad experience that shows there has been improvement, even if people pay more attention to the bad reports then the good, just like we all care more about who shocked us at the VMA's rather than who actually showed some class. (ie, N'Sync, but I digress.) Yes, there are schools where there is poor remedial programs, and those schools are supposed to be targeted for government intervention. From all the press you'd think it was a high percentage of schools, but it is not. Many of those districts also have a high transience rate and that makes it hard to keep improvement programs cohesive. But when you look at how schools are rated by states, they actually are improving. Is there a long way to go: yes. But sometimes the school can only do so much and it becomes the parents job to enrich their children's intellect. It is  the whole environment, not just the place where you send your kid 6.5 hours a day that makes your kid a learner.
