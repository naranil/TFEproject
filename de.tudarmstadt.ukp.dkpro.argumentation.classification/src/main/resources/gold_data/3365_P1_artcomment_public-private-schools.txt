The writer overlooks the biggest problems facing our schools today . They are under control of two evil entities with agendas that favor themselves not our children The first group is the Federal Government via the Department of Education which takes control out of the hands of the local school districts and sets rules and agendas disguised as ciriiculum -example is Common Core-. The second group - the teacher unions that put the interests of the union leaders and the members ahead of the students. The parents who are able to make use of private schools are still forced to support public education with tax dollars even though they get no benefits in return.The public school system has become the modern day worst case scenario of "taxation without representation".
