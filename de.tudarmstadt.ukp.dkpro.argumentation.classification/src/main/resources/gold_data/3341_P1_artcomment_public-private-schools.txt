I am in no way "Wealthy" however I chose to send my children to private school that has a religion based background.  Our schools are taking God out of the schools and that is my main deciding factor.  I am involved as a parent, why is it that we have religion in Jails but not in the public school system.  And I think its every parents right to chose to educate their child as they see fit. The curriculum is much more hands on and students learn more.  They could do this at public schools but do not. So I think your argument needs a lot more supporting facts.  Seems to me that you would send your child to private school if you felt you had the means.  Where there is a will there is a way.  There are grants that can be available too.  If the government actually spent money on the school system instead of other things that would be different.
