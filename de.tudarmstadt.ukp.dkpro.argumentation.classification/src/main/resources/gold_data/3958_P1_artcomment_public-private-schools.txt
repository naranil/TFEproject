Go on Netflix and watch "Waiting for Superman". Quite the eye opener. It's not uncommon for public school teachers to send their own kids to private schools. What does that tell ya about are public school system? In this documentary the superintendent of schools in Washington DC offered to double teachers salaries if they were willing to give up their tenure and get out of the teacher's union. (Teachers get tenure after only 2 years of teaching which makes it virtually impossible to fire them for any reason.) They could choose to stay tenured and keep their salary or give it up and double their salary. The teacher's union refused to allow it to be voted on by the teachers. This superintendent was trying every possible way to improve the children's education and the union shot it down. If you can afford to send your kids to a private school or if you can get them into a charter school do it. Public schools are not going to change even if you and every other parent went up there and complained everyday because the unions won't allow it.
