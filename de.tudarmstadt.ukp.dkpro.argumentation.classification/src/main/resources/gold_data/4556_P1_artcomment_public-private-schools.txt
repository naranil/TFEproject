Are there any statistics on privately and publicly educated students being accepted to Australia's top universities? I went to a state school for the first 3 years of high school where I recall not much of my education there- it was mostly "Australian". Then my parents moved me to an all-girls catholic school (I was being bullied at the public school) where the value of education was much higher, academic achievements were celebrated and we had motivational speakers regularly. I'm sure that socially I would have stayed the same had I stated at the state school, but not academically.
