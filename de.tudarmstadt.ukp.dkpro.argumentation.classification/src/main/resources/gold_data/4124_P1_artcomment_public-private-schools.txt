If you can afford it, why not give your kids a great start in life and give the country a good supply of well educated leaders of government and industry.  This is just class envy.  I was a public school teacher.  Great, gifted students do not lift up the quality of the school.  Gifted teachers do.  It is unfair to expect gifted students to slow themselves down for the benefit of others.  Let them go where they can rich full potential.
