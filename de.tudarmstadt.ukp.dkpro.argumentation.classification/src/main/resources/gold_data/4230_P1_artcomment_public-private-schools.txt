I have three children with kid's of the their own, one moved to be able to send his kids to a private school, the other home school's her children, while my other children still go to a public school....but they're father is a teacher....thank God!!  public education is for the most part terrible,and it's too bad that our government had to step in and ruin what was working!!  maybe someday we'll elect official's that give the people what they really want, instead of slamming they're own agenda's down our throat!!!
