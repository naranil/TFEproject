Young Mr. Powell is another tragic example of the fallacy of Home Schooling. No matter how well intentioned, few parents have the education, time, and skills needed to teach. Those who find the schools beneath their ideal learning experience should join everyone in an effort to renew our schools, demanding better performance and. outcome and be willing to support the much needed 
funding.
But the belief that the schools and teachers must meet their Christian education agenda ends any discussion. 
The whole issue is just another example of a populace that has fallen into a big ditch, dug by those who despise authority (Nobody tells me what to do), see plots and loss of freedom in every shadow, behind every bush, and in anything that will require them to think before they vote. 
Befuddled wishful thinking rules.
