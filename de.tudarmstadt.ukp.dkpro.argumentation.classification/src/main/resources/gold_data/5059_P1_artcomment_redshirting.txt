Why is it called redshirting, I wonder?
My son was born in December (cut-off Dec.31) and I have been a little worried for him because they would want him to start JK when he's only 3! That's still a baby! But I think I'll just keep him with me until SK and then let him go. I'm not pleased with the full-day kindergarten coming in, but I'll worry about that when it gets closer. (he's 2 now) 
I thought of holding him back, but my husband was always bored in school and so if he's smart like his daddy it might actually work out very well for him to be a bit younger than the other kids. (physically he's an ox, takes after my side of the family!) Besides, you need to think of the kid's future. If all the others are graduating high school at 17, why does he need to be there until he's 18? His whole life is delayed by a year. That's not a favour, in my opinion. 
I'll make sure to remind the teacher of his tender years if he starts getting poor marks for "scissoring skills". :P (surely you don't get marks in Kindergarten? I have no idea.)
