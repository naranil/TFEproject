Allison Benedikt  is so wrong. I had to take my kids out of the public school because it was so bad, it was affecting them emotionally. As a good parent, you try to do your best at giving them the best education it can possibly can. What I think has to improve is, the education the parents give them at home. I remember a time when there were truant officers and parents made sure their kids went to school or they would be penalized.
