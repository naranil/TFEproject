Lady, you need to get your head out of your *ss. There are plenty of good reasons for sending my kids to private school, and guess what, they are none of your business but here are a few. People generally do this because they want what is best for their children. For example, religion is a good thing...the public school does not believe in that.....Christmas is usually referred to as the 'Winter Festival.' Additionally, I don't want my child indoctrinated with leftist liberal crap. The government has proven over and over that they can not be trusted to do the right thing and I am not going to let them take over my child's education. By the way, last time I checked, we are not in Cuba.
