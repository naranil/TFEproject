Of course the government are taking the action descibed.
We live in a world of paedo-paranoia in which no-one can go within ten feet of a child unless they have been ISA Checked, CRB checked and chemically castrated. For the benefit of chidlren of course. 
These same children go to school where they could be introduced to bullying and drugs, and have their education ruined by undisciplined, uncontrolable, disruptive classmates. One at a local school to me was nearly killed in a hammer attack the school were apparently scared to prevent for fear of being branded racist. The family are in the Old Bailey looking for compensation right now. 
If they survive all this lot they can be brainwashed into embracing multiculturalism, diversity, man-made climate change and sex education, even when their parents don't want it for them. 
When Ed Balls thinks about all those children growing up uncontaminated by all this his head must nearly explode.
