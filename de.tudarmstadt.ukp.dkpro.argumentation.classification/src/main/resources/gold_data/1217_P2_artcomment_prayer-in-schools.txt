To pray or not to pray
The founders of this country built Canada on the Word of God, as can be seen in many examples. The name "Dominion of Canada", the motto of Canada, "He shall have dominion from sea to sea" and the phrase on Canada's coat of arms "A mari usque ad mare" (Latin for: From sea to sea") are taken from PSALM 72:8. The preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the introductory sentence (preamble) to the Constitution of Canada's Charter of Rights and Constitution Act, 1982. The principles it invokes are the "supremacy of God" and the "rule of law." In full, it reads, "Whereas Canada is founded upon Christian principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law"
