This lady is something else.  First of all let me say, my children attend a private school.  Our district schools are less than admirable.  Having attended our district schools myself all throughout my childhood, it is clear that our district schools have issues...financially and educationally.  I agree that if I sent my child to a public school I would do everything in my power to help make it a better place for all children but why would I subject my children to that experiment when I have the choice to send them to a private school where I can be involved in the school without having to help fix it?  I'm not saying that private schools are worry-free or perfect by any means but our private school is a hell of a lot better than our local district schools.  I'm still a citizen that pays taxes that go to my local school district...whether I agree with it or not!  Our district will be voting on a budget override for the third time this year.  The override has been cut down the past two attempts but they're urging citizens to vote yes....even though they just approved $150,000 for the purchase of additional visitor bleachers at our local high school football field.  Really?  Maybe when our public school system gets their priorities straight, like quality education, not quantity education, and not buying unneeded items like bleachers, I'll consider sending my kids....wait, nevermind!  No I won't! I'm proud to say that my kids attend a private school and have no plans of making a change any time soon!
