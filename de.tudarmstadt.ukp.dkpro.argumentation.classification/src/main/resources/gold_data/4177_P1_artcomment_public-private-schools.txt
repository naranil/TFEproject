I have two children.  My daughter who is a Junior attends public school and my son who is a Sophomore is in his first year at private school. Every child is different and their needs are different. My daughter does not let the overcrowded classrooms bother her.  She excels in public school.  My son who at the end of his Freshman year had a GPA of 3.8 excelled as well but he was stressed out for 90% of the year because of the classroom sizes.  He would come home so frustrated because the teacher spent most of the class trying to get everyone to focus and pay attention that by the time the bell rang to go to the next class they were left to figure out the lesson for the day on their own or go to tutoring after school which is what he would do.  Only to be more frustrated because there were about 60 kids in the tutoring session who all had questions.  Yes, private school is expensive but not every parent that sends their kid to private school is well to do.  My husband and I both work and make good money, but allowing him to go to private school took some thought in regards to our budget.  We are making it work and I can tell you, that I have seen a 100% difference in him.  He is relaxed and eager to do well and so excited that his largest class has 14 kids.  We are making this sacrifice for him because this is what is best for him.  I would make the same sacrifice for my daughter but she is doing just fine where she is now.  At the end of the day this is a very personal choice that each family has to make for their child individually.
