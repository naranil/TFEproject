I think you should “redshirt” your son, no offense. I am a 12-year-old 6th grader turning 13 in May, so I know what it’s like. Here is my experience and I hope it will help you with your decision: 
In preschool, I had some issues, just like your son. Yes, I knew my ABCs since 2, just like him. I even could read music and knew my multiplication tables and could add and subtract 3-digit numbers (not to brag, but you know what I mean). However, I was behind socially; I couldn’t stand up for myself without swearing (actually using the f-word and such), I refused to ask for help, so I was redshirted. Now I am extremely confident and star in theatre performances, school choir, am going to take ABRSM Grade 7 for Piano, perfected the AMC 8, and am taking Pre-Calculus. So what about being a year older than my classmates? I feel socially confident now, and feel great (except when I got 91.5/150 on AMC 10 and 76.5/150 on AMC 12- I have extremely high standards for myself). Being at the top of the class is awesome. 
Anyways, I think you should “redshirt” your son, but to compensate for him being the eldest child in his class, you should try to get him to excel in something. Anything, it can be his favorite school subject (in my case, math), an instrument (piano), or something else he likes (in my case, ballet). Good luck and I hope I helped.
