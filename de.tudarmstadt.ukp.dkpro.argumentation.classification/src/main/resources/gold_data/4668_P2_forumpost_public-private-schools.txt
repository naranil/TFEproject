I'm the product of a private school education (in the 1980's). My parents made sacrifices to send me and one of my sisters to an all girls boarding and day school (we were day pupils). It was totally unsuited for my other sister as she is hearing impaired and our school did not have the appropriate facilities, whereas the local state school had a hearing unit. 
I would say there are good private schools and bad ones- just the same as state schools come in the good, the bad and the ugly
