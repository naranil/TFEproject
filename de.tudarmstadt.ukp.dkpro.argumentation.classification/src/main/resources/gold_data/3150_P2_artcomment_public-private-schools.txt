I have a friend who has send her children to private school, but will no longer be able to afford it after this year. They are so concerned about the public schools that they are willing to move in order to get the best school district possible. I think the author of the article is in denial.  First, these parents can absolutely do as they wish. Second, just because you send your kids to these schools and advocate because you have money, doesn't mean the schools are going to change. The author makes it sound like the current parents don't give a damn about their children or their education, which is dead wrong. Some parents, yes, but not all. And that is just an insult to those parents who are already fighting to try to get their children a better education in the public schools. The school system across the board sucks. If we get rid of the teachers unions and model the schools after what has been proven to work, then we may be able to work our way back to the top of the education ladder against other countries. I've been a teacher. I've seen some of the worst teachers in the world who have tenure. Who the crap came up with the idea of tenure in the first place? It's stupid! A job for life even if you suck like hell and do irreparable damage to kids because you treat them like poop. We fail our children every day that we send them to school in America.
