In high school I saw both sides of the spectrum of firstly public then private and I am telling you firstly that this idea of buying your kids a "better" class of friends at private is just total fantasy ! At the private school there were just as many riff raff and out of control characters as I had come across at a public school except they were worse as they are used to getting what they want when they want and on a grander scale than most. 
Their parents were as bad if not worse and did not hesitate to throw their weight around and their money to bully the school into letting these little darlings from getting away with their behaviour again and again.Moral of the story was if you had the money then little darling "johnnie" did what he liked.Rules and punishment were never applied equally to everybody. 
Now my son goes to a high school that is a state run school and the way that it is run and improved as it moves forward is truly amazing and I would never dream of removing him from there unless things dramatically changed instantly beyond repair. 
So please stop falling for the preconcieved stereotypes of both public & private and actually due some proper due diligence before sending your kid to a school based on rumour, inuendo and stereotypes.
