Once again, Thank you. I'll make a copy of all this so I'll remember who I can contact in the event we come across any problems. If the speial school were to refuse , or if we decided (alongside the school confirming they could definitely cater his needs) then he would be attending the school to which his pre-school is attached. If that were to be turned down (which I'm reassured wont happen, but I am still nervous) then I do not know where we would go from there, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it if necessary. 
When you say there will be discussions about the schools best able to cater DS, will those discussions involve us (the parents) or all through the LEA etc?
