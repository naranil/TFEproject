The woman is a nut case! Lib mentality on crack! Maybe this woman needs to work and give all her money to the public school system so she won't be a bad person. My children and I all went to public schools. Hated it for them just as much as for myself. If there had been anyway possible that I could have sent them to private school. You betcha I would have. I think private schools are great and hope a lot more come about. I feel the private schools up the expectations and standards for the public school system. That's a good thing. And that's what scares these selfish people that want to take away people's freedom and start calling people names just because they are envious of what others have or do!  After all, the public school systems get tax money from everyone, even from the one's who send their kids to private schools. And the public school doesn't provide anything for those kids, but the system still takes their money.
