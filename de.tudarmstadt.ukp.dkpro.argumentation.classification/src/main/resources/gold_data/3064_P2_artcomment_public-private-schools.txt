Written by a person that has no concept of the world works. She feels that if I don't send my kids to public school I will not be involved, doesn't she realize that either way I pay taxes to support public schools and therefore as a real person I am concerned about how my tax dollars are used. According to her logic since I don't have any family members in the military I wouldn't care about the defense budget, or I'm not collecting welfare, so who cares how the money goes out, and any number of budgets. If she thinks her idea would solve the educational system, she needs to grow up and open her eyes. Does she really think parents control the schools or, are they controlled by the source of their funding? Actually sounds like her argument is a more supportive of using private schools where the parents can have more say in what happens because they're funding it.
