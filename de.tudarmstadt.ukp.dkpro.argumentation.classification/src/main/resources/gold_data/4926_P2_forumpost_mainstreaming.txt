maybe he is like dr jekyll and mr hyde
has SEN at school..needs lots of support
perfectly NT by the time he gets home...
i'm sure that is what most schools think lol.
seems to be the other way round for me atm cos my son has meds for when he is at school...but not for when he is at home...then they say he's a handful and i'm like "no ****"
