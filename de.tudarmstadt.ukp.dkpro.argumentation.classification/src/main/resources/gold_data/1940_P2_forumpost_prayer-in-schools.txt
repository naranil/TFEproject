I just thought that the above comment about the Supreme Court deserved further comment. A person has to be either asleep or rabid not to be aware of the make up of the Court. 
This is from the University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School course on Constitutional Law.If conservatives don't like the liberal agenda of the Supreme Court, you would think that they would stop appointing all of those liberal justices. 7 of 9 appointed by conservative and ultra-conservative Presidents. And yet some ranting theocrats declare a liberal agenda. Poor persecuted christians.
