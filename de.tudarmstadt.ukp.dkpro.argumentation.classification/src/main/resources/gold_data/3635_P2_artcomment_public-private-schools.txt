So why don't the parents of the kids currently at crappy schools fix the problem?  Why do they have to wait for me or parents like me to come along and fix the problems they have been ignoring?    The writer should be encouraging more home owners to send their kids to private schools.  The money towards education will still be received via property taxes, it just will not be utilized by the tax payers' kids. It is basically free money to the district at the expense of "bad parents".
