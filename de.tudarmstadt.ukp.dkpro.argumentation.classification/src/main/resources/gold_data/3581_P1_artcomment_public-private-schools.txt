The advantage of private school is simple, my money pays for my daughter to be surrounded by like-minded teachers and parents who all want the same thing for their children, a top notch education.  The teachers and administrators are all held accountable and not beholden to a system that is more concerned with keeping people employed, per student spending and providing free breakfast and lunch.  It blows my mind to see a public school student with a cell phone, but the parents can't afford a box of Cheerios and a ham sandwich. Teachers in private school make a fraction of what teachers make in public schools.  I know exactly what is spent per student, the check I just wrote.
