this idea that kids need just one more year to be a kid... perhaps for some parents, there's some truth to it. when i was a kid, back in the dark ages, there wasn't day care, pre-school, 4 year old kindergarten, we didn't have all these things kids can do via the rec. dept. on the cheap, the dance classes, soccer, softball, on and on ad nauseum. when i was a kid, i was allowed to be a kid until kindergarten, where my mother had the choice of half day or full day kindergarten. there wasn't even the designation of 5K; there was just KINDERGARTEN. your kid turned 5, you sent them to KINDERGARTEN, boom, done. if you had to do something and be child free during that time, the munchkins went to gramma or the teenage girl 3 doors down the block. now, parents do all this crap to give their kids a leg up, get them ahead of their peers, send them to umpteen different activities, get them in pre-school, and now this redshirting thing. too often, parents are doing it because it's the done thing now, not because they have any sense that it will actually benefit their child; someone said it was a good idea, so they did it. we didn't put our daughter in day care, pre-school, or 4K; ppl thought we were nuts. she was allowed to "just be a kid" until she started school at 5, and for every one of the last 4 years she has continued to "just be a kid". she is academically ahead of the curve, she is a social butterfly (which she did NOT get from her wallflower mother), she didn't suffer for me deciding that i was very capable, tyvm, of teaching her myself, and that "socializing" at the park and the play areas at the mall was fine for learning how to interact with her peers. she takes one dance class, 45 minutes every saturday, because she asked if she could, not because i think it's good for much of anything; she likes to dance and maybe she'll learn to not be such a clod. all this pressure i see on other kids, and where's the benefit? what DO you do, if you hold them back that first year? i am in the somewhat, these days, enviable position of being a stay at home mom, and i am a nerdy book worm, so it's easy enough for me to fill her time at home with education, and in such a way that she doesn't think she's being taught, ha ha sneaky mom. how many of the redshirted kids have parents who can do that, as opposed to paying for extracurricular programs? the flip side is the parents who HAVE to put their kids in day care and pre-school, because they both work, and how many of them really find that their kids are SO much better off when they finally start school? i have not found one study that shows any tangible benefit to redshirting, and yes, i have looked, because it made no sense to me when i first heard of it, but i thought maybe there was some validity to the idea just the same. but, no, i don't see it. if you want your kid to just be a kid, DON'T put them in all these activities, unless they ASK to do them. there's no academic advantage to keeping your kid out of school for an extra year, if all you do is put them in some kind of kiddie college, or if you won't or can't teach them on your own. there's no social advantage at all; the best place to learn to be social with kids of all ages is a school! these few children who are really JUST not ready for prime time, maybe i can see it, IF these kids are doing something to help them in w/e area they are lacking, but to do it for sports, or just because they need that one extra year to "just be a kid"? no.
