Thanks for an entertaining, very timely infomercial for conservative state governments. Our kids attended state schools and excelled, one to doctoral level. They did comment that private school students at their university experienced more difficulty than state school educated kids... and research indicates that coddled, spoon-fed learners have trouble coping when that silver spoon disappears... . 
SV, that reflects my personal experience of teaching matriculation courses in TAFE. About 80% of the time you could pick the private school repeats, who immediately asked 'what's the answer?' rather than 'how can we work it out?' As always there were honourable exceptions.
