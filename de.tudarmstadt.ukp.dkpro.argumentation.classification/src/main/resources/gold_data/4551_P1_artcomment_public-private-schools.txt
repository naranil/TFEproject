I never intended sending my sons to a private school but having got elected to my local primary school council and been immersed in the curriculum review process it was clear that there was a huge miss match between the idealistic educational model, the resources, quality of teachers (most then worn out) and the many problems of many students requiring attention to basic skills. Moved to private system which has same lofty aspirations but they cull out the students/families they do not want, have better age/gender balance and have slightly better resources. We were told one of our sons was "a bit slow" by his Year 2 teacher and not to expect too much. He won school prizes for 3 out of 5 subjects in Year 12 at a highly regarded private school. It is important to note that class sizes are similar in most private schools with better curriculum and less problems with students/parents making life simpler for parents. Unfortunately parents I speak to recently have same or worse experiences with public school system. Teachers I know who have moved from public to private are amazed at how much easier teaching is because the school is able to insist on basic standards of behaviour and doing things like homework. I think Sally Young needs to talk to a few parents who decided to switch to find out the reason is more pathetic performance of our public school system despite massive increase in funding over the decades. 
Another dose of honesty! But who is this 'miss match'?
