You ask the same question of the teacher as any parent. Why associate the teacher's answer with race? Plenty of parents home school for exactly the same reason you do, to improve your child's education. 
You recon she said your son was doing well in comparison to other black children? I recon she said it, because she is a stupid teacher and she says that to all parents for an easy life. 
Some parents accept that answer, you didn't. Good luck to you for that. But I suggest that this article should be about "education", rather than "black children in education'".
