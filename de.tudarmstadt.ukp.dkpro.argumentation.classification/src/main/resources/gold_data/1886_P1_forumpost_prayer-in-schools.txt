Wow. This brings up a related topic about children's rights. Please look forif you're interested. 
A good question here is how much does this cut into a parent's right to raise their children. If they wish to raise their children as atheists, that is their right no matter what anyone thinks. So therefore they must put up with the school forcing a faith, no matter how shallow, on them? 
This is a sticky subject. Some think of evolution as teaching atheism. Some view much of what as taught as "secularism." But none of this is praying to Darwin, or claiming him, or anything, a deity. 
If the shoe were switched would those so quick to treat enforced prayer as something that hurts no one if they were taught to pray to Allah, Zoroaster, Zeus and the Gods? Or recite over and over "there is no God?" That would still be a step beyond even what those who complain about secularism are complaining to God. No matter how much we may or may not respect Darwin and what he brought forth, he was no God, as I'm sure all would say. 
This is where the difference is. Teaching things that contradicting any belief, or lack of belief, is one thing. Teaching "God" and then praying to that deity is something else, and just as problematic as teaching "no God" then insisting all recite "There is no God" at some point in the school day over and over. 
Now if those who would prefer the be public school prayer have no problem with children reciting that last one too, and also showing similar respect to any other deity(ies) any of them might possibly believe in, or their family does. I have only one more problem. Where would we find enough time for an actual school day?
