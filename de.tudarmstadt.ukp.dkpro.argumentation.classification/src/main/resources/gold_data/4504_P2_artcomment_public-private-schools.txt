Sally,
One glaring issue:
"they've paid high real estate or rental prices to be in suburbs where the local state schools are mostly, and consistently, very good." 
That's not true in Stonnington, which doesn't have a public high school - AT ALL. Kids living near Punt road are told to go to Hawthorne.
