"Benedikt writes that if you can afford private school, chances are your child will come from an environment that allows them to overcome “a perfectly crappy public school.”" Honestly this sounds like sour grapes that some one can't afford to send their child to private school and had a chip on her shoulder against those who can. Every private school I've ever heard of offers scholarships for some students to attend, so just because Susie down the street goes to one, it doesn't mean that she has a privileged life that will allow her to thrive based on economics in her house.   This doesn't even begin to account for the quality of schools. WHY, as a parent, should I send my child to a terrible school if I have other options? Full disclaimer here - we have very few private schools in our area (all are religious) and our school district is actually pretty good. Even so, parents can only influence the schools to a certain degree. I have a couple of friends who have transferred their children to different elementary schools because they encountered issues that were "deal breakers" to them and that the schools were unwilling to work with them on.   When you accept the responsibility of having and raising a child, you accept the responsibility of doing your best for that child to help them thrive and succeed in the future. The education they receive is a large part of that, and if private schools in your area are superior, and you can manage a way for your kids to attend, then you have every right to do what you feel is in their best interest.
