I have a december baby and a may baby — my dec son went to kdg at almost 6 b/c of a sept cutoff and my may son went to kdg at slightly over 5 …. I didn’t debate and didn’t lament – - I did what the cutoff suggested AND guess what? Around third grade, everything evens out and I see it with all the kids – they are all doing what they are supposed to be doing when I look at both my sons and the rest of their classes. There are true outliers in both directions based on personality vs when they started school. I totally agree that this segment was driven by helicopter parents. We must say that our kids are doing what they should be doing b/c they are who they are and not say things like performing at the top and exceeding this or that because IMO – we just propel the argument. 
I did like what they speculated in the segment about what will be with all these kids as adults – I am so curious! RB
