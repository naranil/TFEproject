I believe in discipline, accountability, and excellence.  These things are not attainable in public schools because the poor teachers and administrators are worried about getting sued by the parents for everything. The public school system the way it is now is not an option.  Plus, I live in a right wing state whose legislators take books out of libraries on religious grounds and who tried to remove teaching the theory of evolution.  Nope, public school not for me!
