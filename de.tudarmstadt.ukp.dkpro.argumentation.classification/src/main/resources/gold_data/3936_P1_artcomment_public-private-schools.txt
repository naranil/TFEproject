she is obviously a liberal.  only a liberal buys into the if you make more money you have to give to the poor mindset. what she fails to recognize is, the more money you have, the more you give to charity. you donate your time, you give away clothing/shoes/coats to the needy, you assist with fundraisers to raise money for the poor whether it be for school supplies, food banks, etc. people with money give more. simple as that.  you don't need to take additional tax dollars to prove that.  i live in an area (Georgia) where there is no way in h*ll i would send my kid to a public school here.  it is not safe, the teachers are cheating and it is riddled with gang activity.  sending a child whose parents have money to a private school doesn't mean they are bad parents, it simply means they want more for their child.  if that means sending them to private school, then so be it.  no difference in home schooling.  you can demand all you want, but unless you have a school system that worthy of sending any child too, then it's all for not.  teachers claim they are not paid enough.  well, excuse me, but you did know that before you decided to become a teacher. you had to intern somewhere?  you had to research it before you decided that would be your major? you say you have to spend your own money for supplies.  why?  demand the school provide. if they can't provide, you can't teach. if you can't teach then someone will take notice.  private schools will always be around. always have been whether it be Catholic school or Christian school.  it is what it is.  don't try to make parents feel guilty about it.  if you don't like the way the public schools are then elect better leaders.
