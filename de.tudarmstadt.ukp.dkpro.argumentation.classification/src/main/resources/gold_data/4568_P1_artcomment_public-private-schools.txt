Tried for three years to keep my children at the local public school. On the school board etc. If they want the middle class to leave their kids at public school they need to put effort in to meet their educational needs of the children and give us a reason to stay not just fob us off with your children will be all right because of their demographic background. The standard was set at the lowest common denominator with no effort put into challenge children who were bored. They need to bring back classes where all children's needs are met not just the worst behaved, why should the whole class be punished because one child's behaviour. Composite classes should be discouraged as teachers are unable to meet all the levels needed and are more likely to ignore those who can do the work at the higher grade. They do not have time to offer more complex work or seem reluctant to celebrate intelligence, attention to detail and completing work that comes from the higher achieving students. In all of the three years before baled from public school despite talks and promises that things would improve nothing changed. We left and went from bored, hating school children to excited about learning, keen to get to school ,enthused again. Not exactly over night but certainly by the end of the 2nd term at the new school. Public schools need to do more to keep those of us who care about education attending their schools.
