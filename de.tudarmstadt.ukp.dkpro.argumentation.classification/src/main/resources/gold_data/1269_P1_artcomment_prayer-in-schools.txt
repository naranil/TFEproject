There's no place for prayer in the public school system. And this from a survivor of 12 years' Catholic school. If you want religion in your school day, go to a religious school. Or go to your church / mosque / synagogue after school. 
Teachers have enough distraction and discord to deal with in their day to day work. They don't need this. Public schools should be administered for the public (that's why they're called "public"), not any cultural or religious group.
