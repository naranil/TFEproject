Kudos for Josh Powell for his voyage and for his reaching out a helping hand and heart and brain to his brothers and sisters. I know one family that have very successfully home taught their children -and can vouch for the basic intelligence and content knowledge of their children-but I also recognize thta not all such efforts are succesfull 
Josh's case is different and he deserves lot of credit and recognition for his uphill voyage and especially for reaching out to help his brothers and sisters 
I was more than somewhat dismayed at reading all the "usual" infighting by commentators,who went right for the left/right divide that we collectively choose to use on our comments-
