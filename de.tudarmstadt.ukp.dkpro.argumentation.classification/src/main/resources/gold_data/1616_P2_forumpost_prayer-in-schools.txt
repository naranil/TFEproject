Prayers, wishes, hopes to a god or generic spiritual theme are OK if there is no dogma attached Can we stop people from wishing, or hoping,? or is it just God the problem? In the big picture of a FREE SOCIETY --it requires a God concept,a developing conscience and a general plan to enhance and ennoble society; otherwise we must fall under some kind of oppressive control, Note that Godless Russia survived only with ruthless oppression. My personal thought is, we must start building a God , virtue, and idealism into our society as did our forefathers, Agnostics, atheists,should appreciate the societal value.
