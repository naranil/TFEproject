Some really good points have been expressed here. For the record I believe in live and let live. Do what you like (within the law), just don't impose it on anyone else. 
We've heard about public school space being allotted to accommodate one religion and its demand for a dedicated space. Muslim prayer is strictly segregated. Gender segregation violates our Charter of Rights and Freedoms which, under Section 15, prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race; national or ethnic origin; colour; religion; gender; age; and mental or physical disability. Sexual orientation has recently been recognized as a prohibited ground for discrimination under the Charter. 
Are gay Muslim students allowed? It's public space and if they aren't, why aren't they? Are Christian students interested in learning more about Islam allowed (silently and respectfully, of course, (with their Bibles as a point of reference?) How about Sikh children? Hindu? Buddhists? Are the doors open to them also to observe Muslim rites taking advantage of publicly funded space? 
"Respect for all religions" (the stated mandate)sounds really good if you're a politician.
To what other religions that violate our Charter of Rights does this extend?
