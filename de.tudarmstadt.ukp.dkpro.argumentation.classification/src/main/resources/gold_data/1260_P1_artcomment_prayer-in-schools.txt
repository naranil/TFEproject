If Muslims are required by their religion to pray several (is it 6?) times a day, and this space is being allotted so the Muslim youth can practice their religion properly... why is this prayer only being conducted once per week? This timetable would seem in opposition of what their faith demands. I am convinced more satisfaction is gained from the fact that they will be allowed to halfheartedly practice their faith in a public school rather than actually practicing their faith properly an a place of worship. 
And boo hiss on any Canadian institution that would allow discrimination against gender to be practiced on tax-payer funded property.
