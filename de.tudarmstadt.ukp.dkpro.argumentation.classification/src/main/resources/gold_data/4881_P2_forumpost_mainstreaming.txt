Have a read of this document stating law and good practise about inclusion
You need to report what is happening to OFSTED, as this could be a case for discrimination against your Son and his right to attend a Mainstream setting, provided they can meet his needs and this includes a duty to confer with Parents about any issues etc 
Hope this helps
