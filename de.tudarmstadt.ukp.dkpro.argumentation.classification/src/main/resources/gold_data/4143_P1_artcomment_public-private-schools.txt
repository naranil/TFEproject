Putting our children into a bad system to improve it is like buying a bad car from a company that is in trouble for it's quality problems.  You get a bad car to drive and no guarantee that you have helped the company.   YES we need to improve the public system.  NO I will not subject my child to a bad education to a system that has done everything wrong for the last 30 years.  Instead of fixing the problem of what to teach, we have a governing body that wanted to add class hours to an already bad system.  So now our kids are exposed to more bad teaching.  My son benefited from sacrifice that affected me and the wife into our retirement. We have no regrets as he is now trying to "fix" the problem from the inside by teaching in public schools.  The competition that private schools give to public will only improve the latter.  Miss Benidikt makes the statement that "you want the best for your child but your child doesn't need it".  That is the kind of thinking the Chinese and Indian culture is hoping you will continue so
