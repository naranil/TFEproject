I have been elementary school teaching children for over 18 years and between my observations, research articles, and a comparison of grade scores of students in the 5th grade (teased out by relative age). The older peer students do better and struggle less in school. There are no good answers as long as we hold on to the production line model of education. If parents would step up and demand schools be child centered we could make a difference. In a child centered program all students are on individualized tracks. We would have to get rid of traditional A, B, C, D, E grading and move to a mastery based program. The problem with this is: far too many parents and politicians want us to reach 21st century goals with early 20th century methods.
