Co-ed schools these days are becoming morally corrupt.Most Kids are distracted,do a lot of sexting,indulge/experiment in sexual acts,go on emotional outbursts (act like adults!) and so on... Schooling is not a time for all such acts and learning falls by the wayside.No wonder why our educational standards are sliding.. Co-ed schools are also the cause for some boys dropping out of school when in fact the society benefits by keeping these boys engaged in education and make them complete school.some posters here have admitted girls could better benefit by attending single sex-schools than co-ed schools. Co-ed schools don't cultivate the cooperation or better understanding between the opposite sexes, That's a myth...otherwise why would you have high rates of divorce and acrimony just a few years after they graduate out of co-ed schools and colleges?
