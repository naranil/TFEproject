Not particularly unusual among the people I know. I just had nothing in common with the people I went to school with. Why should I? The coincidence of age and living in the same area were all there was to go on. You could call that in itself a very narrow prospect. The friends I had were of all ages and from a variety of different localities. 
A school doesn't need to be 'a nightmarish bully fest' to be a bane. All it needs to do is to fail to provide a totally unstimulating environment. Which mine did. It was boring, tedious, slow and frustrating. I learned nothing that I did not know before other than a handful of French verbs which have so far been of as much use as a chocolate fireguard. 
Each to his own, as I said. If you really enjoyed school, good for you. But don't assume that one size fits everybody, because it doesn't.
