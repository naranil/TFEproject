I think putting a 4 year old on kindergarten is more about the parents need to prove how superior their child is than it is about what is best for the child 
Or, more likely, it's a low to middle income parent, and they'd rather send the child to school than pay for another year of daycare while they work. 
Neither of these scenarios were true for me. My daughter had a late August birthday and a Sept 1 cutoff. She was ready, I sent her.
