By looks of it, your children live in a household with two parents and have a (employed) male role model. I think the outlook for them is probably rather good. Poor school performance, underachievement and school drop out rates among young males seem to be significantly correlated (this does not necesarily imply causation) to single parent households and absent fathers. Good luck.
