As for the complaint about overcrowding in a Georgia school district, the problem with public education in Georgia is the right wing "government is evil" fanatics who will not support the schools with their tax money. But beyond that, when you Souhern right wing religious fanatics fill the minds of your young with creationism and Bible based science, they'll never compete in college, must less in the wider world. There's a Georgia Congressman named Broun who is on record as believing that Evolution and the Big Bang theory of the universe are "lies straight from the pit of hell." That is ignorance on a level beyond imagining. But that's what you teach your children.  Too bad you lost the Civil War. The country would be much better off today without you ignorant right wing religious fanatics. I just feel sorry for your children.
