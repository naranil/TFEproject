Wong states, “Your local school stinks and you do send your child there? I bet you are going to do everything within your power to make it better.” But he must know this is not at all true ... parents may complain but few are doing everything or even anything within their power to make it better.  Many, many parents object to curriculum choices and emphasis on a social progressive agenda that will not change no matter how much involved they may be. Many object to the outrageous salaries paid to administrators or to the number of administrators but there is consistently nothing done to curb that - and when a school districts budget is voted down they either retake the vote to get a better result or put a 'contingency budget' in place that may actually be higher than the original budget ... it is time to end this system and if I were a parent today I would do everything in my power to get my child out of the public schools!
