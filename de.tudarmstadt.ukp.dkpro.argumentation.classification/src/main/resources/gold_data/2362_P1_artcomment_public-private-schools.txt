A totally wrongheaded argument.  I send my daughter to private school for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are a curriculum and faculty that is superior.  BUT I nonetheless believe in the importance of our public school system and, as such, pay my share of taxes that support it AND donate time, books and other support to our local public school.
