You seriously do not understand critical thinking do you? Your logic is as a good as saying the purpose of water is floods that destroy life. 
Public education is like a genii in a bottle. The defined purpose is the wish, and the students are the genii. We can define any purpose we want, and I assure you, unless we return to liberal education, our democracy with liberty will not be remembered 3 generations from now. When the old die, the democracy we were dies with them.
