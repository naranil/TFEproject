"Most research clearly shows that any gaps in levels of success between younger and older children are usually bridged by the third grade. " 
This is just plain wrong. CNN should not publish such nonsense.
"I have studied how children learn and develop and have been in the field of early care and education for more than 30 years. The greatest part of my knowledge comes from my own children.." 
So, if you studied this (evidently, without much success), why so you resort to anecdotal information?
