I went to public schools, I thrived in public schools - my mom MADE me go to public schools.  I was even a public school high school teacher!  Would she send me to a public school now - ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! Yes, out public school system is broken, but until the PARENTS start caring and actively participating in the education of their children and stop making it solely the schools' job, nothing is going to change.  And as long as the schools live in fear of these parents and "live to serve the public" and don't want to anger parents and are worried about their government funding, they are always going to kowtow to pissy parents and weak teachers and administrators. So yes, if you want a strong, no bull, parent supported, child first, customer service-based, "you will follow the rules or you will get kicked out" educational atmosphere where education and discipline and respect are demanded, then you should send your child to a private school. This is what ALL schools should aspire to be.  And, until America starts realizing that  education is a privilege that should be supported and respected, where teachers are revered, we are always going to have problems.  As the morality of our society crashes, so, too, does the level of morality and level of education in our public schools.
