What about the minority of students who are not Muslim and are barred from using the cafeteria during the prayers? By allowing this prayer session in the school, the TDSB is allowing discrimination and segregation. Non-Muslims are not permitted to participate and female students are required to stay behind the male students. Those who decided that allowing this to take place in a public school (apparently three years ago) should no longer have jobs.
