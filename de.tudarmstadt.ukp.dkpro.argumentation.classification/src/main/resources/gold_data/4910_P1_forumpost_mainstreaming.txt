forgot to add, my son was very disruptive and dangerous alot of the time in mainstream, because he couldn't cope. the teachers were not sufficiently trained to deal with him, we were constantly called to the school to sort it out (when tbh we had no idea how either!) he was suspended more times than i remember and was only on half days! (which i've later discovered is actually illegal)...so no, it wasn't fair on the other kids...not fair on him either. 
the government seem to think that making special needs kids go to mainstream will improve people's attitudes...it doesn't in my experience...they only did it to save money
