I believe the expectations placed on a child are key to how well they will do in life.
Tell a child they're not very bright and should aim low and that's what they will do.
I was an average child at school, left up to my teachers, I would have left school at 16 with a few O Levels and some CSEs. 
Fortunately for me my parents had other ideas, so I went to Uni got a degree and years later did my Masters aswell.
