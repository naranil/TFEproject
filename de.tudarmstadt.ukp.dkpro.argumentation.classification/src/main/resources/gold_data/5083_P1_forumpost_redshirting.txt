Someone always has to be the youngest and someone always has to be the most immature. It doesn't matter what the cut-off date is, there will always be someone who falls into each of those categories whether they are one and the same or not. You will also always have someone at the top and at the bottom when it comes to academics. 
If my oldest was in the grade where she fits SOCIALLY she would be in 3rd or 4th. She is a 13 year-old 8th grader with a fall birthday who is at or above level academically. If she was down one grade it wouldn't make much difference socially since she is SO far off, but she would be further ahead with academics, totally bored, and would have other issues there as a result. I don't necessarily think that social skills or academics should be a sole deciding factor when figuring out when to start school.
