I went to private school in "the hood" in Los Angeles.  I also went to public school in a wealthy area in San Diego.  Private school wins, no matter where you go.  Why? Children are taught, not only the mandatory curriculum, but also how to be considerate, disciplined and respectful. Granted, this should be taught at home.  But if you know that what your child is being taught at school emphasizes what you're teaching them at home and they're being supervised at all times, and they're getting a good education, how does that not make sense? In the future, should I have children,  they will without a doubt be enrolled in private schools, K-12, just as I was.
