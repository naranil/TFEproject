That is by far the most convoluted line of reasoning I have ever heard.  Very short sighted and downright foolish.  GONE are the days of parent controlled school boards where parents actually have a say in what occurs in schools.  Our local public school just sent a letter to incoming Kindy parents "please do not attempt to engage the teacher in conversation" ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!.  Parents are not even allowed in the building.  Good luck trying to make reforms.  I for one, don't believe in public education at all.  HA!  Contrary to the premises of this article, maybe we should scrap the entire "crappy" public school system.
