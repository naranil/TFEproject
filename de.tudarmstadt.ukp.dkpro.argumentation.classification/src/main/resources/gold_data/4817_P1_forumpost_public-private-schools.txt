I don't know. Around here, there are plenty of choices, but the government only pays for public education of various types and those who can afford private schools pay for those above and beyond their property taxes that fund the public schools. 
I just disagree that if public schools went away, all these wonderful educational facilities would magically spring up and everyone would be educated and the world would be a better place to be. The only reason most private schools show good numbers is because they can completely ignore all the problem students. Just getting rid of public schools isn't going to get rid of problem students and SOMEONE is going to have to deal with them.
