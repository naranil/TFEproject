In our case, my daughter is born 1 day before cutoff date (8/30) making her the youngest in the class. She went to preschool for 2 years and had lot of social issues and anxiety issues. We were in the best school district and she was going to a very good school which my son attended too. We changed her to couple of other schools thinking it is with the school. She used to come home with complaints and never ever speaking in the class. She was academically doing good as per other kids but clearly lagging behind in other areas. Seeing her anxiety issues, my pediatrician begged me to hold her back. It was very hard as a parent to make the decision but we held her back after careful consideration. In the long run, I want my kid to be happy and confident. Since the school began (3 months) , she adjusted so well in the new school and all her anxiety and social issues were gone. She is happy, made so many friends and speaking up in the class. She is extremely social and zero complaints. I am thankful to my pediatrician for bringing this up. We are glad we made this decision and held her back because i don't want her to carry these issues all her life. Finally, I am not against or for for holding back but it depends on each kids case.
