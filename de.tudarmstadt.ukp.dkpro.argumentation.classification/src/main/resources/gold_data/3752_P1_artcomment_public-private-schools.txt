I feel my education was a perfect balance.  Private through 8th grade then public HS.  This idea looks logical on a Macro level sure... but it would take at least a couple generations before it paid off. Parents today can shell out some cash and skip the "Reform Period" by going private.  Private schools = better education? Not necessarily but it typically has a stronger sense of community and common morals among families.  If you don't want the liberals corrupting your child with issues such as mandatory acceptance of homosexuality, private schools are the only way to go. It's not that I was taught that it was wrong, it was never a topic that was brought up. We were taught tolerance and acceptance. Its just in public schools they force acceptance almost to a point where it is encouraged.  That is what is wrong. They have a Gay Straight Alliance club, but if someone were to form a Straight Straight Alliance club they would be demonized and labeled as "intolerant" which is complete BS.  The people who are demanding "Tolerance" are the biggest hypocrites of them all. All of this is avoided at most private schools.
