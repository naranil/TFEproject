@ Danot "There's a lot more to be learned at school than the syllabus. It provides children with the chance to work and play with their peers and promotes the development of social skills and interacting with people outside of the family." 
You don't need school for this, since this can be provided by a properly functioning community of friends and relations. People were able to learn social skills long before there were schools. What schools actually promote, of course, is not "social skill" but social conformity, social obedience, and social subservience to an unelected "authority" external to the family. Home schooling, on the other hand, promotes independence, especially independence from the state - which is the reason totalitarians hate home schooling so much, and ban it so happily.
