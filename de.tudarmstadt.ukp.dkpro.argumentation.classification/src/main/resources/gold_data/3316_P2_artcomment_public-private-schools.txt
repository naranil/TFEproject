We home schooled our kids and they are now in nationally acredited virtual school systems. We moved to an area that was supposed to have a "good" school district. however, when they found unhealthy levels of mold and dust mites in their kindergaten classrooms, the administration handled it so poorly that I completely lost faith in thier ability to not only educate my kids, but the look out for their well being while they were in school. We did get involved, but we were the one's that had the state health inspectors come in and force the administrations hand. Had we not done that, they would have done nothing. As it stands, they "cleaned up" the issue, but never found the source of the mold. When I asked how they would ensure it would not come back, they just threw up their hands and said they cleaned it up. 2 years later we saw the Kindergarten teacher and she was displaying alergy symptoms just like 2 years before when they found the issue.   So their badness led to my badness and my kids are still well adjusted and well educated.
