First: If your going to say something that, learn to spell "allowed". Second: How do you know He is fake? Obviously you are not religious, so before you say anything that hurtful or so wrong, go read the Bible. You might learn something important, like, God is NOT fake. SO if you are going to say that God is fake, YOU are wrong. He is very much real!
