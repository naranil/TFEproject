When I go to the grocery store and the check out gal says "$22.54 please" and I hand her a ten and a five and she rings it up before I can hand her the 54 cents, she is completley lost. Can't figure out to hand me 3 dollars back. WIthout the register, she stands there with a completely lost look on her face. 
I'm starting to think they should ALL be held back.
