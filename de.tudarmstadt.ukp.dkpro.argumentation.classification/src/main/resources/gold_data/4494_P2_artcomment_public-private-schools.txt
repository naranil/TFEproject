The politics of envy?
I think it's a question of perspective. You could view the private vs public in elitist privileged class terms or you could view it as a healthy sign that a significant proportion of Australians think that the public education is under resourced. 
They choose to resource the education of their children at a higher level than the state thinks is adequate - thus as a society we are shown as valuing education higher than our oft quoted OECD rivals. 
Of course the rise in the influence of religion in the education sector of our otherwise secular society is another question.
