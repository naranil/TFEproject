Depending on who you speak to, there is also anecdotal evidence that there are significant risks in vaccination babies. But the science indicates that the risk is almost negligible. Science can be wrong, but by far I'll take science over anecdotal evidence. :) 
Single-sex schools do not mean living in a monastry. Any decent school will have various other contacts. However, more importantly, a rounded upbringing includes children being involved in other extra-curricula activities that allows them all sorts of interactions with a wide variety of people. 
In the end I would like to emphasise two things:
1) People have suggested that there are pros and cons, and yes, this is obviously true but the implication to some may be that all this 'washes out' in the end. This is NOT true. Again, do the research. Studies clearly establish that single-sex schools are, IN GENERAL, better for educational outcomes than co-ed schools. 
2) All this is based on generalisations. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the individuals in this and the individual schools themselves. I believe these factors play a more important role in determining the better school for the child. 
Nevertheless, all things being equal, I think it is generally accepted amongst educators that single-sex schools at high school level is better for learning outcomes than co-ed schools.
