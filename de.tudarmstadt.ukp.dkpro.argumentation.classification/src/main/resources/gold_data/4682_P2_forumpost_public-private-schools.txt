We chose home schooling. My wife has a university degree and we found the perfect curriculum. It is a sacrifice because it means we have to make do with one income, but we also save on what we would have spend on private school. We also enrolled the kids in extensive extra curricular activities, karate, chess, music, etc. And they all go for extra math lessons (wife also works at the Kumon math center - so we get it for free). They are all about three years advanced in math beyond their age years. 
There are excellent home schooling curriculums around both Christian and Secular. Do some googling and reading on the subject. Look especially for curriculums based on the Classical method. 
Classical Curriculums emphasise Latin and Greek, History, Art, Science and Geography all in a blended format. My eldest son has just completed three years of Latin and is starting on Greek now. He is 12. 
When they get to High school age they are enrolled to take the Cambridge Exams and their SATs at age 17 and 18. Their university entrance is based on their scores from those exams.
