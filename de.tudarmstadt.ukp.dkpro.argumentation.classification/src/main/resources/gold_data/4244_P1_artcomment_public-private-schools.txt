When a parent has a child that is of school age, there is not enough time to bring about changes in the local crappy public school. Everything is broken in that school and it is not  going to change overnight or in 3 years. In addition, people are mobile and may not own a home in the community and do not see it worth their time to invest in making changes happen. Do you go to the overwhelming number of parents from that school and say " stay home more and spend more time with your children so that they can do their homeworks and behave better"? There many other problem than parenting alone.   The author did not look a the big picture.   Justin.
