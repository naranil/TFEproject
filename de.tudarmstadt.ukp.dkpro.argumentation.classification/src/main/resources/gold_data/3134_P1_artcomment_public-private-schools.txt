I don't buy it. The bad schools are bad because of things that take too long to correct - longer then the period of time my kid will be in the school. Life is short. Kids grow up fast. They don't have this time to waste. More power to those that choose not to subject their kids to the socialist and enviro-wacko indoctrination being served up by the teachers unions and school boards
