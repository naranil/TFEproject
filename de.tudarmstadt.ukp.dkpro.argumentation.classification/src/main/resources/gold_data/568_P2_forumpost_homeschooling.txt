I'm curious from people that homeschool. Say your child came to you and asked to be in a classroom setting for one year just to see what it was like. What would be your reaction? I realize that's a hugely broad and general question, but I'm still curious. 
For me, it would depend on her age, her reasons, the situation at the school she'd be attending, and any other special considerations I'd have to take into account (i.e. if she needed an accelerated track but there wasn't one available).
