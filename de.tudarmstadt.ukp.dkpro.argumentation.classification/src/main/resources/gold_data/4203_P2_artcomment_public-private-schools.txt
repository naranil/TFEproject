Compelling?  No.  Allison Benedikt's arguments are fragile and flawed.  Really compelling and accurate are the arguments expressed in the various comments posted hereon, some of which reflect mine. If we gave credence to Benedikt's arguments, then executive officials, members of Congress and of the judiciary, who are parents, too,  should be required to send their children to public schools.  For, precisely, they are fully equipped with power and influence to change the entire public school system.
