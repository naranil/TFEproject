I taught in public high schools for 15 years.  My advice to parents?  Run, don't walk, to the nearest private school.  Public schools are not about education; they are about social engineering.  Parents had a stake in their public schools when they were neighborhood schools.  Neighborhood schools were community gathering places, where parents, kids and teachers all came together and all knew each other.  My high school graduating class had fewer than 50 seniors, yet PTA meetings had to be held in the auditorium. One high school where I taught had almost 2,000 students; what passed for PTA meetings were held in the principal's office.  The school board for my system was made up of lay people, each of whom had a personal agenda that had nothing to do with education.  In 15 years I never saw a board member visit either of my two schools.  Public schools are fad driven.  Remember new math?  Of course not.  No one does.  Cooperative education?  Social advancement?  Mainstreaming?  At the Tech school where I taught seniors once had five hours of shop class in the trade they came there to learn.  Then those who ran public education decreed that every child should have a college-prep curriculum.  When I left that school, seniors were lucky to have two hours of shop; the rest of the time they spent taking courses for which they had no need, desire or use.  Public schools have failed at their purpose because they have lost their purpose.
