I have to say that I am very sympathetic to home educaters. I once read, admittedly in a pro-home-ed publication, that a child, if properly taught, can learn as much in two hours at home as a child could learn in an entire school day at a mainstream school. The child would then be free to pursue other valuable activities such as art, playing etc. 
If done by parents with the right mindset, education levels and resources, I cannot see the problem. 
OTOH, one does read and hear about people who withdraw children from school because they have some dispute with the school about discipline (school tries to, parents object) or because the school has failed to address bullying concerns. In those cases, children can end up being home-schooled by people who may not have the attitude or aptitude for it. 
I can also see how child abusers could use home-schooling as part of their evil plans. Why wouldn't they? I don't think we should pretend it couldn't happen but I agree that the automatic suspicion of the government is, in itself, highly damaging.
