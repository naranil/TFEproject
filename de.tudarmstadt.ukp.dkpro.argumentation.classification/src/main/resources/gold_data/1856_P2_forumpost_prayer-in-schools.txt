Not very well informed at all. I didn't even bother applying to any universities when I got my GED; I just applied to open-admission community colleges. Even after a year of college coursework, I was still rejected when I put in my application. Now that I'm wrapping up my second year, I've got one application acceptance from a university. Still waiting on news from the other two. It does affect your ability to get in. Badly.
