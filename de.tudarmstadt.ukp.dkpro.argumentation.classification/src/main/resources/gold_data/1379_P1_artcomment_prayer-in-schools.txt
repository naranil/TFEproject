Somehow everyone against this seems to be missing the fact this is only a space where a certain activity is allowed. This has nothing to do with religion, unless you count the fact that the people in question are muslim. This is not "religion in schools", it is no different than a chess club meeting or basketball practice. Maybe we should ban ALL extra-curricular activities from taking place anywhere on school property. In fact, why stop there? we could ban the very thought of anything that is not school-related and sanctioned by the state. Except christmas, of course. EVERYONE should be subjected to hideous decorations, forced consumerism and annoying music for at least 12 days every december.
