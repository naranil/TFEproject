I say, do the opposite of what that ignoramus Benedikt says, and send all children to private schools, with parents choosing the schools.  When someone becomes n the decision-making process, from beginning to end, then that can only improve the education system. All kids can "afford" private schooling, since the money being spend in public schools belongs to the taxpayers, and that money should be re-directed towards private schools via parental choices of schools.  That way, any faiiing school or failing teacher, can get the boot, and the parents maintain control of the quality of the education that heir kids get.  That Benedikt is only interested in having government keep control over people's lives,and in retaining union control of the school system and the funding from the taxpayers.
