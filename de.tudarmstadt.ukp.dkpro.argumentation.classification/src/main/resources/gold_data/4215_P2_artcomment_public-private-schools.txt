Parents who send their children to a private school are not doing the public school system a diservice; they are doing a disservice to their children!  The same for parents who send their children to a public school. It is the parents responsibility to educate their child(ren); not that of strangers. Throughout the centuries it became the norm to send children off to that hellish institution (more commonly referred to as public or private school), so both parents could work (How else could a family afford two luxury sedans and an annual family vacation?).  Let's face it most parents I know (and many has testified to the fact) can't stand being around their own children all day so  ..........be thee child off to the school and give us no lip!  Yeahhhh, I'm thinking end times and Children of the Corn!
