I think it's ridiculous to be up in arms over a homeschooled student switching to PS, or using some PS programs, when PS take all of the tax money regardless of whether the student is in school at all. If anything, people who homeschool, send their kids to private school, or just never have kids at all, are actually helping the schools by pumping in more money without adding in more kids.
