I am a scientist and I believe in data over anecdote, yet I experienced the beneficial effects of single-sex education myself. After co-ed public high school and a freshman year at a co-ed university, I transferred to a women's college and the difference was astonishing. Women spoke. Assertively. Being intellectual and smart was cool. Speaking up was cool. When I went to law school, and later to grad school, I could always pick out the women who attended women's colleges. We all could. 
Sadly, my college chose to go co-ed years ago. It left a hole in my heart. Had I a daughter, I would encourage her to find single-sex schools.
