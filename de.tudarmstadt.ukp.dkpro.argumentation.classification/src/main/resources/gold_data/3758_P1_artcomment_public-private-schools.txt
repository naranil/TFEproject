Once again "free" shows its worth.  Parents that can afford to give their children better do which means you get a condensed group of non caring parents.  The only reason the government cares about public education at all is the control and the potential revenue.  What more proof “free” public education has failed, the highest test scores across the nation come from Home school kids.   They are courted by the top colleges and prove their worth time and time again.  Why?  Concerned active parental involvement.  Those that constantly expect someone else to clean up their mess raise children that act the same, no personal responsibility. Teach them yourself or take a lone and send them to private school but get your kids out of “Free” public education if you want them to ever succeed.
