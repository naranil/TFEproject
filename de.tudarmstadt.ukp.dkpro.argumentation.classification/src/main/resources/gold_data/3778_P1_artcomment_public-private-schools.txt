This unfortunately is why people go to private schools.  The public schools are in trouble because they define away problems.  Criminal conduct is called something else so the school does not get a bad reputation.  In an effort to appeal to everyone the public schools give up standards.  And, finally, isn't the customer right.  If I do not get the service I want, I take my business somewhere else.   This woman's thinking is backward.  It is the public bureaucracy that needs to change.  We need less fringe classes and a focus on traditional core subjects, i.e., math, science, English and composition.  People move away from public schools for good reason.  Public schools in my experience are more violent.
