This article is a joke.  Are you serious?  Public schools are a disaster.  I would know, my mom was a public school teacher in a middle class school.  My parents sent me to a Catholic school.  Since my mom was a teacher at a public high school, she felt that I would be better educated in a private school.  I learned discipline, good study habits, morals, a good work ethic in the Catholic school I attended.  I also learned to have an appreciation of life long learning.  We also learned service to others and didn't become part of the "me" generation.  Since we had uniforms, I did not obsess over what to wear to school.  I am still not a fashion maven because I realize that what you wear is not as important as who you are.  My children will also go to a Catholic school if I ever have any.  I received the best education possible!
