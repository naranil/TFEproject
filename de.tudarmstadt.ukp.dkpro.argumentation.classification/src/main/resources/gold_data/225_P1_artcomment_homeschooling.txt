When I was teaching Intro Psych in SW Virginia in some of community colleges and local colleges I ran into the same thing. There were home schooled students in the class that did not even have the fundamentals down. Worse yet even the most successful ones while good at rote items were quite helpless and pathetic when it came to independent or critical thinking. 
Again it was another of those cases where keeping them uneducated and ignorant keeps them in the church.
