Public schools are a joke.  My tax dollars pay for children who can't afford to attend private school. Which gives your kids the opportunity to attend public school.  Which means I pay for mine and yours.  No monetary breaks for me and mine yet I don't complain that my tax dollars are going to inferior teachers, kids that are being raised by retarded parents and lets not forget metal detectors and pedophile staff.  And don't let me start with the bullying epidemic.    Kristin Wong your an idiot for even bringing this up, and Allison Benedikt your a loser.  Get a real job and pay for a real education for your children. Public schools can't be fixed.
