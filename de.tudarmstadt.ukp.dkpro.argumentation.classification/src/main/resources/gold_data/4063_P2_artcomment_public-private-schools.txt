Moronic Logic... "Wealthy parents should forgo a private education for their children and instead invest in the public system." This article misses doesn't address the MAJOR point in that "rich" people pay property and state income taxes and get no benefit from public school since they pay tuition for their kids to attend private school.  That means the $$$ for their kids GOES to the public school.  The real question is why our public system, the most expensive in the world, isn't performing? Or maybe it's the parents commitment.  In our town the public schools are great!  But, parents are involved and there is ZERO tolerance for bad behavior.  The school has a modified grading system...A 93% is a "B", a 87% is a "C" and a 81% is a "D".  The town has 7.5% unemployment , 45% of the kids on assisted lunch program and Average per capita income of under $45K/year.   It can be done if the parents and school work together!
