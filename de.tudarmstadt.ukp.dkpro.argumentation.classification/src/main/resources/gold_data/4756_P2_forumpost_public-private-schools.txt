You know many people inadvertantly bash the teachers when it isn't their doing at all. I support teachers 100% but their union is bad news and corrupts the politicians who take their money. 
I was in school during the late 50' and 60"s. I was always in advanced classes when I attended government schools. When I transferred from a Catholic HS in 68 as a Junior, to a Government HS, they put me in a low level English class. The teacher immediately took me out of it and placed me in an advanced class during another period. The result was two lunches as a bonus. One before Gym and one after. What a racket. 
Point being, all sudents learn at different levels. To ignore this reality is to dumb down students in the interest of equality. This is Communist in its ideology and application. The goverment is more interested in making students more equal rather than educating students through individualism. 
And they wonder why it isn't working.:rolleyes:
