I sent my child to a private all girls Catholic Academy. She was Valedictorian with a 4.38 GPA (out of 4)  Yes she probably would have done well in our local school system. BUT admissions officers would not have paid nearly as much attention to her.  As it is she got a $30,000 per year SCHOLARSHIP to a prestigious Engineering research university.   Don't punish me and my child because other parents don't appear to want to spend the time with them to forward their advancement.
