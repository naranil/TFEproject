It all depends on the public school.
My daughter goes to an excellent public school in Durbs and their is nothing lacking in the quality of their education. Also living in Somerset West, our (former white) public schools continue to outperform our private schools. 
Then again the truth cannot be said for our neighbouring Maccassar.
