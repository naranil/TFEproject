If I had not taught at a school where there were gun fights in the parking lot and teachers were robbed at gun point, I still would not think that sending rich children to public schools would improve the schools.  If they're bright kids, they will be put into IB/ AP classes or into magnet schools. No improvement needed there.  If they are behavioral problems or not too bright, they might fit right in to the general population.  They could also pull the, "Do you know who I am" routine? to impress the teachers and administrators with the power they possess. "I'll tell my Daddy and you'll get fired!" Let's fix the public schools by creating vocational schools so that those who are not interested in careers that require college educations can come out of school capable of earning a living. Let's put teachers back in charge of the classrooms.   Let's stop making ridiculous academic requirements of our kids.  Unless you are aiming at being an engineer, you do not need to know quadratic equations.  Why on earth do we require Algebra II for graduation? How many kids learn to speak a foreign language in school? We water down the more difficult classes so that the students who are not capable of doing the actual work can pass the course.  I saw a boy who could not add whole numbers put into an algebra class.  We have lost our minds.
