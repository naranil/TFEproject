When the school is crappy because administration cares more about the money going into their pockets and less about the kids actually getting an education, there isn't much parents can do.  They re-route tax dollars to themselves.  Happens all the time. In addition, I don't like the liberal slant to everthing that is taught in public school.  I like knowing I have a say is what my children are learning. No parent would be able to change that in public school unless they are trying to get the school to be more liberal.
