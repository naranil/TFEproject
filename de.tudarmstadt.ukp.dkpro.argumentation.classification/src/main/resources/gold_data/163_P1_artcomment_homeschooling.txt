Thank you for bringing this tragedy to light. I am a Christian, an educator, a student and a parent and I have seen too many children like the Powells. As an admissions officer, we had applicants whose "record keeping" consisted of sending boxes full of paper for our office to review as part of the application. If their students did get an interview, which was rare, they didn't have the social skills to survive the first round. 
I personlly am acquainted with four families who are home schooling their large families. All four have no intention of book-schooling their daughters past age 13 as they need to learn :homemaking skills". One of the girls, who has not been taught for two years, could be Josh Powell's twin. She is intelligent and desperate to learn, but her parents won't allow it. It is heartbreaking. 
That the Commonwealth of Virginia has such a rich tradition of the education of young people and allows this travesty is shameful. All of us, no matter our religious beliefs, need to pray that the law changes before more smart children are left behind.
