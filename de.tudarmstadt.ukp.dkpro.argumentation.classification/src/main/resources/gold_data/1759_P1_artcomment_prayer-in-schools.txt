People should be free to worship when, where, and who ever they want. All of you who want prayer out of schools keep saying go to a Christian school but why should we have to go to Christian school when the very foundation of the “public” was founded on Christianty? If you go to a school that did force prayer then I can see where you would be offended or upset, but the majority of schools that had prayer did in no way force it on anyone. The first amendment does not say “separation of state and church” however it does say “FREEDOM OF RELIGION”. Why should the majority of Americans have to do something we don’t want just because a few people get offended? All of you nonbelievers are all for “do it quietly” or “go to a Christian school” but what makes you think we don’t get offended by that? Many of you say it shouldn’t be allowed and we are wrong for wanting it, but what makes you think you are any better to not wanting it? It doesn’t seem fair that you can talk bad about our religion and the Lord in his self but we can’t talk good about Him. All of you are complaining about how we are trying to force our religion on you but look at yourselves, you all a trying to force our religion out of us as well.
