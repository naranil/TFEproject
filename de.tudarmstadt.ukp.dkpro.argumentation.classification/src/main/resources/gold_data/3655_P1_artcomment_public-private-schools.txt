Wow!  I don't often weigh in on articles but seriously???  This is such a narrow-minded thought process.  I have two children, one went to public school (finished), the other is attending Catholic school (9th grade).    They are 5 years apart and their personalities couldn't be more different .  We did send my older son to Catholic School as well and it was disaster (he was miserable there, it had nothing to do with education but personality).  My younger son thrives there.   The reason behind sending my children to Catholic school was for Religious reasons and having it stated that is a "less compelling" reason is an argument I won't get into right now.  I say the final decision for most of us is based on what is best for our children, whether it be educational resources, the need for smaller class room size or simply the "family like" atmosphere in most private schools that allows our children to thrive.   In actuality the parents who send their children to private school should be thanked as if every private school student went to public schools there is no way that local governments could handle the influx.  You think the school system needs revamping now? Let that happen and then see what mess we wind up with!    And just as a side-bar most of us who send our children to private school are not rich we make sacrifices to do so.
