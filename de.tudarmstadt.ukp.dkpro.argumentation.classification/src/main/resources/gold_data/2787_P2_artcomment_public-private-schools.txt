Hey, Ms. Benedikt, why don't you go all the way and require all of those who live in the best school districts to take in families from the poorer school districts so that they, too, can experience a quality education?  Surely their homes are too big to just accommodate the needs of one family.  Equality for all.  Wouldn't this be a more fair solution?
