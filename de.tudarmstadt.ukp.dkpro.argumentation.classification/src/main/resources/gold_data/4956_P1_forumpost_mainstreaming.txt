My son currently goes to a special school and I so wanted him to go to a mainstream, but it wasn't happen. 
It took about 2years to actually get a SEN statement. It is a long process but you do finally get there? 
It was at pre-school that noticed is Autism earlier on ,My son want through series of test eyes,ears ,speach theraphy . He was then given a placement nursery I think it is called integrated resource unit placement ( it is a group of 8 children or more, been thought in small units, they really make good progress when in small groups) he was there till he turned 5 and moved on to a special school. 
The special school has a structured program, they even go swimming once a week,take cooking lessons once a week, have music classes,french class 
The school is about 20mins from my home.
It is best you visit these settings and see if your child needs can be met, this should indeed come first 
Find out if there are nurseries in your area who have specially trained teachers who have expereince in teaching children with Autism,ADD. 
At the end of the day its the progress of the child that counts
