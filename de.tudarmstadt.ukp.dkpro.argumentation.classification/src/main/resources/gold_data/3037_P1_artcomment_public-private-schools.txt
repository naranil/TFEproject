The whole premise of this is flawed. People have taken their children out of public schools BECAUSE of the poor quality of education. The downturn in quality didn't start with people taking their kids out, it had been going on slowly but surely for years. Lack of discipline, turning teachers into babysitters, banning prayer and the Ten Commandments, and refusing to have anyone fail are just a few of the weapons that liberals and the Federal government have used to turn the public school system into a disaster. They have been screwing things up for decades now and to dymb to see the error(s) of their ways.
