Due to the alignment of our school system, my 9th grade year was spent in a junior high, where I was averaging a 1.6-1.7 GPA and tested a grade or two or three (depending on the subjectâ€“I've always been horrible at maths) below my level in every subject. There was talk about holding me back a year. 
Well, guess what? The next year, I went on to 10th grade and to a high school environment, where I earned a 3.2 my first semester and 3.1 my second semester. Why the turn-around? One reason was, as I mentioned earlier, because I left behind the bullies that were interfering with my education (it's hard to study when you don't dare to take your books home on the bus, lest they be stolen and ripped up.) I also went from being in a school with a few hundred students to nearly 4,000, which saved me from the severe bullying that I'd experienced; the anonymity, coupled with the rush to get to class through the crowded hallways, put bullying on the back burner for the majority of students. 
And I also learned that I had (and still have) anxiety issues that interfered with my test results, which is why I tested "stupid." As it turned out, a mere two years after leaving that nightmare of a junior high, my ACT Test scores were high enough to earn me a state scholarship that helped cover my college expenses. In fact, the English skills section placed me in the top 3% of the nation... which was a far cry from being forced into the lowest reading group that the junior high had to offer! 
To look at my grades and test scores in 9th grade, you wouldn't have thought that I was capable of handling 10th grade... I was MORE than capable, but the old environment was stifling my educational ambitions. Parents, and teachers, need to examine each student very carefully before making a decision to hold them back. I simply got lucky and slipped through the decision-making process as the usual process of education churned me through its mill.
