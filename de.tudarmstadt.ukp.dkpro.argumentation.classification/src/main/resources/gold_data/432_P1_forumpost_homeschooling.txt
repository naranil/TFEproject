I feel like homeschooling depends particularly on the parents who will be teaching. I find it very difficult to imagine being homeschooled, but that might also be because I don't know anyone who is homeschooled. In my country parents can only homeschool their child if he or she has a mental or physical disability or the parents don't agree with the worldview (christian, atheist whatever) of any school within a reasonable distance to their home. In short the government doesn't allow homeschooling except in special circumstances. 
I think that there are advantages and negatives to both homeschooling and public schools. But in general I have found the elementary and secondary school model in my country pretty good and comfortable. Obviously, schools have certified teachers who have to meet certain standards (though some horrible teachers slip through sometimes) and homeschooling doesn't have that but on the other hand parents know their children much better than any teacher will so the education can be more focused on the needs of the student. 
Ultimately I cannot say one is better than the other because I've always went to public schools and they have always suited me well (regardless of some annoying teens). I have never experienced homeschooling and don't know anyone who has, so i can't say to much about it :)
